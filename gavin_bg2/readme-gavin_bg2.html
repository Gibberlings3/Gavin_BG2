<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>This mod adds the NPC Gavin Mor to your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> game. Gavin is a Dawnbringer of Lathander.</p>
  <p>If you met Gavin in Baldur's Gate, you may pick up where you left off or you may decide that you met him for the first time in Athkatla. The choice is yours.</p>
  <p>Once in your party, Gavin will banter with all BioWare NPCs. He has an extensive friendship track and can be romanced
  by any female Bhaalspawn whose wisdom and charisma are 8 or higher.  Enjoy!</p>
</div>
<h2>Compatibility </h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>This mod is designed to work with Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn with or
  without the Throne of Bhaal expansion pack. The mod should be compatible with other 
  <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> mods. </p>
</div>
<h2>Installation </h2>
<div class="section">
  <p><strong>BGII:EE</strong><br />
    If you use BGII Enhanced Edition from GOG or Steam, you need to prepare your game with 
	<a href="https://forums.beamdog.com/discussion/50441/modmerge-merge-your-steam-gog-zip-based-dlc-into-something-weidu-nearinfinity-dltcep-can-use/p1">modmerge</a> before
	installing any mods.
  <p><strong>Windows</strong><br />
    Gavin for BG2 is packaged and installed with <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> 
    and is distributed as  a self-extracting archive. To install, simply double-click 
    the archive and follow the instructions on screen. </p>
  <p>Alternatively the files can be extracted from the archive using 
  <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/">WinRAR</a>. If properly extracted, you should
  have a gavin_bg2 folder and setup-gavin_bg2.exe in your 
  <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder. To install, simply double-click 
  setup-gavin_bg2.exe and follow the instructions on screen. </p>
  <p>Please run setup-gavin_bg2.exe in your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym>
  folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components. </p>
    <p><strong>Mac OS X</strong><br />
    If the mod was previously installed, uninstall it before extracting the
    new version. Gavin for BG2 is packaged and installed with <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>.
    To install, simply extract the contents of the mod into your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> directory.&nbsp; If
    properly extracted, you should have a gavin_bg2 folder, setup-gavin_bg2,
    and setup-gavin_bg2.command in your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> directory.
    To install, simply double-click <strong>setup-gavin_bg2.command</strong> and
    follow the instructions on screen.</p>
  <p><strong>Linux</strong><br />
    Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify.
      Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="http://www.weidu.org/%7Ethebigg">WeiDU.org</a> and copy
      WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal, cd to
      your BG2 installation directory, run 'tolower' and answer Y to both queries.<br />
    You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already ran
    it once in the same directory. To save time, the archive is already tolowered,
    so there's no need to run the first option (lowercasing file names) either
    if you've extracted only this mod since the last time you lower cased file
    name. If you are unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the
    safe bet.<br />
    Run WeInstall gavin_bg2 in your game folder to install the mod. Then run
  wine BGMain.exe and start playing.<br />
  Note that this mods assumes that you have oggdec for linux.</p>

</div>
<h2>Contents </h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>The mod contains several components that can be installed independently
  of one another. </p>
  <p><strong>Gavin for BG2</strong><br />
  <p>This is the main component that will add Gavin to your Shadows of Amn game.
  He can be found in the Slums of Athkatla, in the Temple of Ilmater on the roof of the Copper Coronet.</p>
  <p>Gavin has frequent banters with the PC. These can be hushed by asking him. If you find his interjections annoying, these can be silenced as well, though he will always react to decisions that offend him.</p>
  <p>To continue a committed romance begun earlier, the PC will need to have met his requirements for romance in BG1: female, good-aligned, wisdom of 10 or better, charisma of 12 or better, and not an assassin, bounty hunter, or necromancer. To choose this option, you can recognize the ring you find in the opening dungeon, or you can acknowledge him as "love" in his joining dialogue. To begin a new romance in BG2, do not recognize the ring and avoid calling him "love" in his joining dialogue. In BG2, any female PC with both wisdom and charisma of 8 or better who is not an assassin may begin a new romance.</p>
  <p>If the PC is male and if Gavin knew him in BG1, Gavin will have a short romance arc with Imoen after she is recruited in Spellhold.</p>
  <p><strong>Gavin heals the PC when below 50% health</strong><br />
    <em>Requires <b>Gavin for BG2</b></em></p>
  <p>Some players appreciated the fact that Gavin would heal the PC when his or her health dropped below 50%, other players did not. Now the component is optional. Please note that if you install this component, you can disable the auto-heal behavior at any time through player-initiated dialogue, but if you don't install the component, he will only heal the PC if you select him and cast the spells manually.</p>
  <p><strong>Multi-romance cheat</strong><br />
    <em>Requires <b>Gavin for BG2</b></em></p>
  <p>Applies only to Anomen and Edwin.</p>
  <p>You're on your 47th playthrough of BG2, and you really, really wish there was a way that you could get in as many romances as possible. Or maybe you're a saint in real life, but you'd like your pixelated alter-ego to live a more daring lifestyle. Either way, you would like to see all the conflict dialogues, but you don't want relationships to end over them. If you install "No romance kills" you can multi-romance to your heart's content. You'll still get all the conflict dialogues, and somebody may even say that the relationship is over, but it isn't. This component affects Romantic Encounter reactions, too. Gavin will complain, and you'll get the conflict dialogues, but a relationship will never end because you've got too many names on your dance card. If you mortally offend Gavin by telling him off bigtime or kick him out of the party in an exceptionally rude manner, the relationship will end, but it won't be because you were seeing someone else.</p><br />
  <p><strong>Alternate Portraits</strong><br />
    <em>Requires <b>Gavin for BG2</b></em></p>
  <p>This multiple-choice component allows you to optionally install one of six
  alterate portraits for Gavin.</p>
