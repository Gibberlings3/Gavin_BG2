@109  = ~If... if I must.~

@111  = ~(For a brief moment, you see a perfectly ordinary garden spider on the plank floor, but Gavin immediately stomps on it.)~

@113  = ~Gods... I think I'm going to be sick...~

@115  = ~It's just a spider, Gavin. You don't have to go to pieces like this.~

@129  = ~Wonderful.~
@130  = ~You mean you were not impressed by the way I manfully threw myself upon that vile creature to prevent it from doing further harm?~
@131  = ~Ah, well, it was worth a shot.~
@132  = ~That's only because I have not yet had to battle fearsome gibberlings to clear a path between you and the bar.~
@133  = ~Should any gibberlings appear to test the veracity of that statement, I will fight them forthwith... and then I will go to bed.~
@134  = ~No, probably not, but you already know what my faults are.~
@135  = ~True enough, I suppose.~
@136  = ~You are. Anyway...~
@137  = ~Please don't. You'll make me blush...~
@138  = ~It's already too late for that, isn't it?~
@139  = ~Thank Lathander for that, at least.~
@140  = ~Do I? That certainly comes as a surprise.~
@141  = ~Good to know. Perhaps you'll tell me what some of them are, next time we're alone.~
@142  = ~Mostly miss, I'm sorry to say.~
@143  = ~Thanks.~
@144  = ~Heh. I wasn't worried a moment ago, but now I am.~
@145  = ~And this is why I'm so lucky to have found you.~
@146  = ~I still do, odd as that sounds.~
@147  = ~I'm thankful for that, but it doesn't mean that I want to stop trying.~
@148  = ~It's probably too late for that, anyway.~
@149  = ~That wouldn't be how I'd go about it, anyway, if such a thing were even possible.~
@150  = ~I'm glad you think so.~
@151  = ~I would not rule me out so casually. You can't be certain the enemy won't laugh itself to death.~
@152  = ~That hurts.~
@153  = ~I can't say I'm surprised.~
@154  = ~Always.~
@155  = ~Well, I'm off to bed before I humiliate myself further.~
@156  = ~Tomorrow is another day, and I think it's time I turned in.~
@157  = ~Well, now I've seen every part of Athkatla, and I've got to say I'm not impressed.~ [bgav130]
@158  = ~I'll be sure to take the matter up with the Council of Six, next time we're invited to a planning session.~
@159  = ~What didn't you like?~
@160  = ~That's right. You prefer smaller towns, don't you?~
@161  = ~Is this going to be a sermon about the evils of poverty and the unjust persecution of minority races?~
@162  = ~It isn't Waterdeep, but as cities go, it isn't bad.~
@163  = ~I don't like it either, but we're here because we have to be, not because we want to be.~
@164  = ~Heh. No, I guess the Council won't much care what I think.~
@165  = ~Where do I start...~
@166  = ~I do.~
@167  = ~(sigh) Never mind.~
@168  = ~I've never been to Waterdeep, but I don't imagine it's much different.~
@169  = ~So does that mean you don't want to talk about it?~
@170  = ~No, I'll talk.~
@171  = ~Sorry, Gavin, but I don't.~
@172  = ~This city has everything. Poverty, disease, crime, prejudice, corrupt politics, it's all here.~
@173  = ~You forgot to mention the night life.~
@174  = ~It's like that everywhere, Gavin. Any time you've got a lot of people competing for the same resources, you'll have inequality.~
@175  = ~What would you do differently, if you were in charge?~
@176  = ~And it also has art, music, culture, and a thriving economy.~
@177  = ~None of those things really affect us, Gavin. We're just passing through.~
@178  = ~Oh, no. We aren't talking about this again.~
@179  = ~Fine.~
@180  = ~I've never been much for carousing myself... except for the occasional pint at the local tavern.~
@181  = ~I know. It just irritates me because I know there are little things that could be done to improve the lives of the poor.~
@182  = ~Little things, at least to start.~
@183  = ~We might not be here to stay, but that doesn't blind me to the suffering of others.~
@184  = ~Take Waukeen's Promenade. Goods are bought and sold there every day. Some of the items are clearly luxuries, not necessities. If the Council imposed a tax on those items, it could use that money to improve housing.~
@185  = ~The Council of Six is made up of merchant princelings, Gavin. Their whole families have made their fortunes on trade. Do you expect them to enact laws that reduce their profits?~
@186  = ~I doubt enough people are buying luxury goods to raise the kind of money that would take.~
@187  = ~It would just make Athkatla less attractive to merchants. Silk merchants also sell linen, so if you drive the silk merchant away, you'll have less competition and higher prices for those that remain.~
@188  = ~You'd have to regulate it, and you'd have to know exactly what each merchant is selling. I can't imagine that every trader will be eager to divulge his inventory.~
@189  = ~That might work, but it wouldn't solve every problem.~
@190  = ~If you say so. I don't want to talk about this anymore.~
@191  = ~Fair enough.~
@192  = ~I would hope they realized that they serve the poor as well as the rich, but that might be too optimistic.~
@193  = ~Maybe not, but it wouldn't take much. You can buy a woolen blanket for a silver or two, and that would at least keep the cold out.~
@194  = ~Perhaps, but I don't think a small tax would drive them away. If a man can buy a vial of perfume for five gold pearls, charging him an extra silver won't bankrupt him.~
@195  = ~Then that's pandering to criminals, and it's wrong... but given the fluid nature of most merchants' stock, it might be difficult to enforce.~
@196  = ~No, but it's a start.~
@197  = ~And then there's the Temple District. Helm has a second temple in the Bridge District, and Ilmater has shrines in the Slums and in Waukeen's Promenade, but why don't you see more clerics in other parts of the city?~
@198  = ~I would have thought I'd see some of my brothers in faith ministering to the sick in the Slums or in the Docks.~
@199  = ~Not every cleric is like you, Gavin. Not even all Lathandrites.~
@200  = ~Maybe they're there, but you haven't seen them. How many clerics walk around in full vestments?~
@201  = ~If you want help, you have to ask for it. Maybe they're too proud to ask for help.~
@202  = ~To what end? If you help one, you would have to help them all, and that simply isn't possible.~
@203  = ~It's just the way things are, Gavin. Moaning about it won't help.~
@204  = ~I'm not trying to shut you up, but we really do need to get moving.~
@205  = ~Maybe not... but it bothers me to think that people who are supposed to care could be so indifferent.~
@206  = ~I'd like to believe that, but I don't know if I can.~
@207  = ~This shouldn't be about helping only those who ask for it, nor should the size of the task be any deterrent.~
@208  = ~I can't accept that, <CHARNAME>, because if I did, I would have to abandon hope that better things are possible. I can't do that.~
@209  = ~But here I stand, passing judgment on others while not doing anything to help myself. It makes me a bit of a hypocrite, don't you think?~
@210  = ~Yes, actually, it does.~
@211  = ~Not really. You've prompted me to help beggars in the past, so you are doing something to help.~
@212  = ~You care and you speak your mind. What more can any of us do, at the moment?~
@213  = ~Personally, I don't think Athkatla has any problems that can't be solved with a couple of barrels of lamp oil and a tinderbox.~
@214  = ~That's reassuring. Thank you.~
@215  = ~I wish I knew, <CHARNAME>, I really do.~
@216  = ~I really hope you're joking, <CHARNAME>, I really do.~
@217  = ~Alright, <CHARNAME>, the rabbit looks brown enough. Some water and a couple of bay leaves, and it's stew.~ [bgav131]
@218  = ~Good. I'm starving.~
@219  = ~We had rabbit last night.~
@220  = ~Easy on the bay leaves. Last time, it was like sucking on a pine bough.~
@221  = ~Too bad there's no stout to go with it.~
@222  = ~I cut the meat up small, so it shouldn't have to simmer too long...~
@223  = ~What can I say? We have rabbit...~
@224  = ~It was, wasn't it?~
@225  = ~More's the pity...~
@226  = ~<CHARNAME>... why isn't there any water?~
@227  = ~You forgot to fetch it.~
@228  = ~Oh, no. It was my turn, wasn't it?~
@229  = ~Let me see... I set up the tents, you're cooking dinner...~
@230  = ~I thought we had more with us.~
@231  = ~Oh...~
@232  = ~No, you got the water yesterday... and it was my turn today.~
@233  = ~Aye, but I just remembered that I cooked dinner last night, so it was my turn to get the water today.~
@234  = ~We did, but we drank it last time you called a halt.~
@235  = ~And I just remembered that it was my turn to get the water...~
@236  = ~So whose turn was it to cook?~
@237  = ~I built the fire.~
@238  = ~I wondered what idiot took the last of my lotus oil.~
@239  = ~I wondered why this wood smelled so foul.~
@240  = ~I gathered the firewood.~
@241  = ~And dropped half of it on my foot.~
@242  = ~An unfortunate mistake.~
@243  = ~I was busy making poultices. We are running low.~
@244  = ~Did you check our supply? I made a dozen last night.~
@245  = ~Perhaps you should have informed me, or I would not have gone to the trouble today.~
@246  = ~Boo! This is no time for a grown hamster to sulk. I said I was sorry for taking away your lettuce, but you know it gives you wind. Nobody wants to share a bedroll with a flatulent hamster.~
@247  = ~Looks like Minsc is going to be busy for a while.~
@248  = ~I caught the rabbits.~
@249  = ~I gathered the herbs.~
@250  = ~Oh, don't make me cook, please... I'm just so tired...~
@251  = ~The cooking is mostly done. It's just the water we need now.~
@252  = ~Oh... well, I guess I can stir the pot while you go get the water.~
@253  = ~Just eat the meat now. A bit o' undercooked rabbit never hurt nobody.~
@254  = ~No, Korgan, half-cooked rabbit is not a good idea.~
@255  = ~Alright, it doesn't matter whose turn it was. It was my turn to get the water and I forgot. I'll just take the pot off the fire and go get the water now. Care to keep me company, <CHARNAME>?~
@256  = ~I'll go with you.~
@257  = ~It's a short walk. I'll stay here.~
@258  = ~Please yourself. Dinner will be ready soon.~
@259  = ~(Gavin silently leads you down the path to the water and unslings the waterskins from his shoulder.)~
@260  = ~Thank you. I've been meaning to talk to you away from the others.~
@261  = ~What's on your mind?~
@262  = ~You could have said it back at camp. No one was paying attention to us by the fire.~
@263  = ~I'm not feeling talkative tonight.~
@264  = ~You've been under a lot of strain, lately. I don't mean to pry, but I wondered if there was anything you wanted to talk to me about.~
@265  = ~Not really.~
@266  = ~I don't have as much energy as I usually do, but apart from that, I'm all right.~
@267  = ~Are you talking about my relationship with Aerie?~
@268  = ~Are you talking about my relationship with Jaheira?~
@269  = ~Are you talking about my relationship with Viconia?~
@270  = ~I haven't been sleeping well.~
@271  = ~It's hard to explain.~
@272  = ~I've got something for that. It's called prickly tea. It isn't a good idea to take it before you rest, but it's good for a quick pick-me-up when you feel tired.~
@273  = ~I wasn't, but now that you mention it...~
@274  = ~You know she's had a rough time of it, right? I'm probably not telling you anything you don't already know, but go easy on her. In a lot of ways, she is still a child.~
@275  = ~Dealing with the death of a spouse is never easy, and each person responds differently. I'm not saying that she doesn't care about you, because I'm sure she does. My only concern is that she isn't merely acting out of grief.~
@276  = ~<CHARNAME>, I don't want to tell you your business, and I'm the last person who would ever tell you that all drow are inherently evil, but she seems to embrace a lot of the values that have given drow a bad name over the years. I'm not saying this because I hope you will shun her. I just want you to be on your guard.~
@277  = ~I can try making up some mint tea, but I'm guessing the things that are keeping you awake aren't going to go away with a cup of tea. I wish there was more I could do.~
@278  = ~It might be hard to explain, but it isn't hard to understand. Everyone expects something from you. It would drive the sanest of people mad. I wish there was something I could do to help.~
@279  = ~There's something I wanted to give you... and I didn't want an audience.~
@280  = ~You bought me a present?~
@281  = ~Good, because there's something I wanted to give you, too.~
@282  = ~Gavin... I don't know how to tell you this, but I think you might be a little too interested in me.~
@283  = ~You have nothing that I want.~
@284  = ~It isn't something I bought. It's more... well...~
@285  = ~Oh?~
@286  = ~A kiss.~
@287  = ~A pat on the back. You've been a great help to me, in the time you've been with us.~
@288  = ~A word of advice. Don't allow yourself to become distracted from our mission by idle fancies. Nothing will come of them.~
@289  = ~A warning. If you do not stop flirting with me, I'm going to have to ask you to leave.~
@290  = ~You must have read my mind. That was exactly the thing I wanted to give you.~
@291  = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. It means a lot to hear you say that... but there's something I've been wanting to do...~
@292  = ~I... I see.~
@293  = ~(Waterskins forgotten, Gavin steps closer to you. He moves to embrace you, but accidentally hits you with one of the waterskins.)~
@294  = ~Oh, Gavin! (You embrace him.)~
@295  = ~(sigh) Some things never change.~
@296  = ~Whoa. I think you've got the wrong idea, here.~
@297  = ~No, Gavin, it's too soon.~
@298  = ~(You feel his body close to yours... even armored as he is, you can sense his quivering anticipation. He drops the waterskins unceremoniously on the ground and cradles your face in his hands.)~
@299  = ~(For one brief moment, your lips meet in a trembling kiss before he steps abruptly away, blushing to his hairline.)~
@300  = ~I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>... was that too soon?~
@301  = ~Not at all! I wouldn't mind doing it again, in fact.~
@302  = ~No... not too soon, but I don't want to rush things any more than this.~
@303  = ~Maybe a little, but it's all right.~
@304  = ~Yes. I'm sorry, Gavin, but I wasn't ready for that.~
@305  = ~Probably not. Sorry about that. I guess that's the end of that...~
@306  = ~Not at all. (You embrace him.)~
@307  = ~The end of what?~
@308  = ~It kind of killed the mood. Sorry.~
@309  = ~Right. Too soon.~
@310  = ~Probably.~
@311  = ~I wouldn't either... but I think it might be more than I could take. That cold water is looking pretty inviting, right now...~
@312  = ~We'll take it a bit slower, then.~
@313  = ~I'm not sure I was, either. It hasn't... put you off, I hope.~
@314  = ~No, but let's not rush things.~
@315  = ~A bit. I'm sorry.~
@316  = ~Don't come near me.~
@317  = ~Er... nothing.~
@318  = ~I'm sorry.~
@319  = ~Alone at last!~
@320  = ~Are we really out of water, or was this just a ploy to get me away from the others?~
@321  = ~Gavin! I thought you just wanted company on your walk!~
@322  = ~No detours! I'm hungry, and the sooner we get this water for the stew, the sooner we eat.~
@323  = ~We're out of water, all right, but filling the jugs will take but a moment, and necessity leads to other observations.~
@324  = ~I did, but strange new thoughts enter my mind, in such a place.~
@325  = ~How can a man walk amidst such natural spendor and not recall the beauty that walks beside him?~
@326  = ~Flatterer.~
@327  = ~(You kiss him.)~
@328  = ~I think I see where this is going. What if one of the others should come?~
@329  = ~Gavin, no. We have to get the water or we won't eat.~
@330  = ~(Gavin drops the waterskins and embraces you closely, kissing you with unrestrained passion.)~
@331  = ~Oh, Gavin! You know what happens when you kiss me like that!~
@332  = ~Oh, Gavin! Are you sure you know what you're doing?~
@333  = ~(You return his kiss eagerly, letting your touch roam over his body.)~
@334  = ~(You allow him to kiss you, but you pull away slightly.)~
@335  = ~I don't think this is a good idea right now, Gavin.~
@336  = ~Gavin, no! I'm not in the mood for this.~
@337  = ~No one will come. You saw how eager they were to help us with the water.~
@338  = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>... how I want you...~
@339  = ~But we don't have much time.~
@340  = ~We'll have to make the most of it, then. (You kiss him again, pressing your body to his.)~
@341  = ~That's never been a problem for you before.~
@342  = ~You're probably right. But no getting out of it later, understand?~
@343  = ~Then let's wait. Anything worth doing is worth doing right.~
@344  = ~I don't believe it! We're almost within sight of camp, and you're trying to make love to me now!~
@345  = ~No, Gavin. Not now.~
@346  = ~Sorry, love. I lost my head. I'll behave myself... but if I'm going to do that, we'd better get this water back to camp.~
@347  = ~I don't know if we need to go quite yet. I've been thinking, and it might just be time to take that next step.~
@348  = ~Maybe we can stay here and hold each other.~
@349  = ~You're probably right.~
@350  = ~Is something wrong?~
@351  = ~You seem to be getting carried away, and I'm not so sure this is wise.~
@352  = ~No, but I'm really hungry. Can we continue this later?~
@353  = ~You're too eager. It's overwhelming.~
@354  = ~This probably is not a good idea, then.~
@355  = ~(The next few moments pass in a frenzy. When at last you are still, Gavin sighs apologetically.)~
@356  = ~Sorry, love. That was a little fast, even for me.~
@357  = ~Don't apologize. We both knew we couldn't linger here forever.~
@358  = ~You lasted long enough.~
@359  = ~There's always next time.~
@360  = ~Well, at least you're satisfied.~
@361  = ~Come on, jackrabbit. We might as well get back.~
@362  = ~Embarassing, but true enough.~
@363  = ~Your wish is my command, love.~
@364  = ~<CHARNAME>, this is an important step for both of us. I'm ready, but I don't want you making a decision like this in a moment of passion and regretting it later.~
@365  = ~Think it over, and if your feelings are unchanged, speak to me again.~
@366  = ~I'm sorry, love, but I don't trust myself. My feelings for you are too strong and my desire, too great. If you're ready for greater intimacy, tell me later, when our heads are both clear, but I'm afraid that holding you now would just provoke yearnings that are better left undisturbed.~
@367  = ~I agree. That cold water is looking pretty inviting.~
@368  = ~Thank the gods for an understanding woman!~
@369  = ~I don't blame you for being disappointed. I'll do better next time... I hope.~
@370  = ~I'm sorry, love, but I'm completely unprepared. I can still make you happy, but let's wait until we have a little more time... and a lot more privacy.~
@371  = ~So, here we are...~
@372  = ~Do you think we have time for a tumble?~
@373  = ~You've been sour and out of sorts ever since our relationship changed. Want to talk about it?~
@374  = ~What did you want to talk about?~
@375  = ~We're here, but we really should be doing what we came here to do.~
@376  = ~Right to the point, eh?~
@377  = ~Whether we have time is up to you. Slowing down is more of a problem for me than speeding up, but will a few moments be enough to satisfy you?~
@378  = ~It should be.~
@379  = ~I like it fast and frenzied.~
@380  = ~On second thought, let's wait until the others have gone to bed. I don't want to rush.~
@381  = ~What happened to tenderness?~
@382  = ~Never mind. If all you have to offer now is a quick poke, I'll pass.~
@383  = ~Time we have, but I'm completely unprepared. No consequences, remember?~
@384  = ~I can still make you happy, but we'll need more time than we've got... and a lot more privacy.~
@385  = ~What's to talk about? You pretty much told me that the only thing you want from me is a stiff thrust when the spirit moves you. I'm doing the best I can, but it would be unreasonable to expect me not to be bitter about it.~
@386  = ~I didn't mean that's all you're good for, Gavin. I still care about you, even if I don't want to marry you.~
@387  = ~We're still friends, Gavin. Doesn't that count for anything?~
@388  = ~Sulking won't get you anywhere.~
@389  = ~Be bitter all you want, but don't bring everyone else down with your grumbling.~
@390  = ~So... does that mean you're up for grudge sex?~
@391  = ~I wanted to apologize for how foul my mood has been lately. I've been having a hard time accepting that the only thing you want from me is carnal gratification. I'm doing the best that I can, but it was quite a blow.~
@392  = ~(Gavin's embrace and the kiss that follows are passionate, almost violent, his attention focused on exciting you as quickly as possible. His arousal is obvious.)~
@393  = ~Is this what you want?~
@394  = ~Yes! Show me how savage you can be!~
@395  = ~Easy, Gavin! Don't rub so hard!~
@396  = ~(You make no reply, but respond by vigorously stroking him through his clothing.)~
@397  = ~On second thought, let's just go back with the water. You can pick up where you left off once everyone is asleep.~
@398  = ~Not at all. I want to be caressed, not mauled.~
@399  = ~If that's what you want, I'll come to you when camp grows quiet.~
@400  = ~Tenderness... is that even still relevant? I can be gentle, if you want, but it would have to wait until later, when everyone else is asleep.~
@401  = ~Would you rather have it gentle later, or have it rough now?~
@402  = ~Now sounds good.~
@403  = ~Let's save it for later.~
@404  = ~If you're going to be like that, you can go to your bedroll frustrated. It will do you good.~
@405  = ~Suit yourself.~
@406  = ~(sigh) We've been through this already. You could have just broken the engagement and let it go at that, but you wanted me to compromise my values and lie with you anyway. You made your choice.~
@407  = ~It does, <CHARNAME>. I just grumble, sometimes.~
@408  = ~No, I would not expect otherwise.~
@409  = ~Point taken.~
@410  = ~If that's what you want.~
@411  = ~(He hurriedly strips off his gloves, then unties the laces on his leggings and fumbles with your garments until he's revealed as much of your body as he wants to touch.)~
@412  = ~(You slide your hand inside his leggings to coax him to greater arousal.)~
@413  = ~(You wrap your arms loosely around his waist and let his hands go where they will.)~
@414  = ~Maybe this isn't such a good idea. Let's save it for later, when we have more privacy.~
@415  = ~What would you do if I told you to stop?~
@416  = ~Enough! You're too rough.~
@417  = ~(If Gavin hears you, he makes no sign.)~
@418  = ~(Gavin seizes your wrist and pulls your hand out of his leggings.)~
@419  = ~I don't need any encouragement, <CHARNAME>. I'm afraid I'll go off too soon, as it is.~
@420  = ~(Gavin teases you with his fingertips for a few moments, then plunges one finger deep into your wetness. He continues this more intimate massage for a few moments longer, then withdraws his hand and drops his leggings. He looks more than ready to take this further.)~
@421  = ~The ground is too wet here to leave us many options...~
@422  = ~(You turn around so he can enter you from behind.)~
@423  = ~(You put your arms around his neck and raise one of your legs over his hip.)~
@424  = ~(You reach around him as high as you can and raise one of your legs towards his hip.)~
@425  = ~If you sit on that rock, I can straddle you.~
@426  = ~On your back, Gavin. No point both of us getting soaked.~
@427  = ~Hmmm. Maybe we should continue this back in camp.~
@428  = ~Ha! Got you going good! You could dry clothes on that thing. Put it away, now. We're going back to camp.~
@429  = ~(He seizes your hips and positions himself behind you, bending his knees for a better angle.)~
@430  = ~That won't work. I'm too tall. Let me pick you up.~
@431  = ~(He lifts you into position, settling your arms around his shoulders and your legs around his waist.)~
@432  = ~(He climbs onto the rock you indicated and waits for you to settle yourself on top of him.)~
@433  = ~(He casts one dark look at you before lying down in the cold mud, then waits for you to crouch over him.)~
@434  = ~Oh, no. You summoned the djin, so make your wish or let it go back in the lamp.~
@435  = ~Alright. On that rock, then, and I'll straddle you.~
@436  = ~Pick me up.~
@437  = ~On your back, then. If you want it now, you can deal with the mud.~
@438  = ~Oh, whatever. I'll do without tonight.~
@439  = ~You're an evil woman, <CHARNAME>.~
@440  = ~I'd stop.~
@441  = ~Then carry on.~
@442  = ~Then I'm telling you to stop.~
@443  = ~(With one great thrust, he plunges into you. His eyes close and he gives himself over to energetic lovemaking and a swift, violent release. When he is still at last, he withdraws, panting.)~
@444  = ~Mmm. I like it when you're rough like that.~
@445  = ~I can tell that was good for you, but you've a long way to go, if you want to satisfy me.~
@446  = ~Well, that was certainly disappointing.~
@447  = ~I'm glad you're happy.~
@448  = ~You're going to have to wait until later, then. I only do one command performance per day.~
@449  = ~I warned you that we didn't have much time.~
@450  = ~Ah. Well, let's just get the water and get back, then. Dinner won't be long.~
@451  = ~Come on. Let's get the water and get back to camp, and after dinner, I'll see if I can fix you something to give you a good night's rest.~
@452  = ~Come on, now. Let me just fill these waterskins and we can get back to camp.~
@453  = ~Let me get my clothes on... and at least some of the mud off... and we'll go back to camp.~
@454  = ~Hey, <CHARNAME>, how about a drink to wash down some of this trail dust?~ [bgav132]
@455  = ~Sounds good. You're buying.~
@456  = ~Trail dust? We've been walking on nothing but paved streets.~
@457  = ~We've got an early start tomorrow. I don't think it's a good idea.~
@458  = ~I'm more interested in food, at the moment.~
@459  = ~How about we get ourselves a room and satisfy some other appetites?~
@460  = ~Alright, first round is on me. I've probably got a copper or two stashed away somewhere...~
@461  = ~A figure of speech. It's been a long day, and we deserve an ale.~
@462  = ~Alright, but you're buying.~
@463  = ~We've got an early start tomorrow, so we'll have to slake our thirst with water.~
@464  = ~We need food, Gavin, not drink.~
@465  = ~Ah, there's nothing like a cool mug of ale to give a person restful sleep, but if you've got your mind set against it, I won't press the issue.~
@466  = ~Alright. Maybe just one.~
@467  = ~Not tonight, Gavin.~
@468  = ~A good hot meal will be better for us, I think.~
@469  = ~I don't approve of drunkenness, Gavin.~
@470  = ~Nothing goes better with a plate of stew than a mug or two of ale, wouldn't you say?~
@471  = ~One ale with dinner, then.~
@472  = ~Milk or water. Those are your choices.~
@473  = ~Forget it, Gavin. I already said no.~
@474  = ~(sigh) Have it your own way, then. I'm going to bed.~
@475  = ~That might be an even better idea.~
@476  = ~And we can always see if they'll send up a flask of something cool.~
@477  = ~It won't make us less tired, but it will help us relax.~
@478  = ~(Quite a bit later...)~
@479  = ~Aye, reminds me o th' good old daysh, the ale an' th' storiesh an' all. We used t' have... life was good.~
@480  = ~You're drunk!~
@481  = ~Yeah, those were the days.~
@482  = ~There were no 'good old days.' We've only been traveling together a short while.~
@483  = ~You're forgetting about the assassins and the blood.~
@484  = ~You can never go back, no matter how good it was.~
@485  = ~Hope so. If not, 'twas a bloody waste o' good ale.~
@486  = ~We can do it again, y'know... at least th' drinkin' an' the carryin' on. 'Twould be fun.~
@487  = ~Nah, we don't need the hangovers.~
@488  = ~All right, just don't sing.~
@489  = ~You're on! Let's get another round!~
@490  = ~Forget it. We aren't safe here.~
@491  = ~Then it's high time we had some!~
@492  = ~Bah, ye're takin' all th' fun out of it. No point in remememberin' only the bad.~
@493  = ~Right now, I'm remembering the hangovers. We don't need them.~
@494  = ~Some parts were all right, I guess, but they're over, and we can't go back.~
@495  = ~Why don't we get another round and you can refresh my memory.~
@496  = ~Whatever happened then, we aren't in Baldur's Gate anymore. We're not safe here.~
@497  = ~We can't go back, no... but that don't mean we 'ave t' sit here mopin' about it. An' b'sides...~
@498  = ~Got medicines in me pack for that. 'Sides, when was th' last time we 'ad us a good laugh?~
@499  = ~Oh, all right. Let's get another round.~
@500  = ~No, we need to stay focused. We aren't here for revelry.~
@501  = ~All right, but if you start singing, I'll leave you here.~
@502  = ~You're forgetting that we aren't safe here.~
@503  = ~Nay, no singin', I promise.~
@504  = ~Ye're a sport, <CHARNAME>!~
@505  = ~When were we ever safe?~
@506  = ~Forget it, Gavin. Go to bed.~
@507  = ~Oh, all right. One more.~
@508  = ~What the hells. I guess we can afford one night of debauchery... but no singing.~
@509  = ~The last thing we need is to wake up with a pair of golem-sized hangovers.~
@510  = ~Ah, ye're a real shpoil-... spoilsport.~
@511  = ~<CHARNAME>? Are you awake?~ [bgav133]
@512  = ~Where are we?~
@513  = ~Oh... my head...~
@514  = ~Is the coffee on?~
@515  = ~Never again.~
@516  = ~We... er... seem to have gotten ourselves into a bit of trouble last night. We're in prison.~
@517  = ~And this is why I didn't want to go out drinking with you last night.~
@518  = ~Did we have fun, at least?~
@519  = ~How much of last night do you remember?~
@520  = ~Where's everybody else?~
@521  = ~And how in the nine hells did we wind up in prison?~
@522  = ~Come on, pull yourself together.~
@523  = ~It's a little late for regrets now, unfortunately. The best we can do is figure out a way to get out of here.~
@524  = ~I'm still curious about how we got *in* here.~
@525  = ~Maybe the mortar's loose, or something.~
@526  = ~They can't hold us forever. Now that we're awake, somebody's bound to let us out.~
@527  = ~(thief) I've got my lockpicks right here. Getting out won't be a problem.~
@528  = ~(gold >50) We've got gold. That opens most locks.~
@529  = ~I thought you were the one with all the plans.~
@530  = ~Oh, we had a fun night, all right. Everybody else went off to sleep, but you weren't tired yet, so we were talking with some of the locals, and...~
@531  = ~I'm afraid it's my fault... as usual. I was on my way over to the bar to get us another round and I tripped or something....~
@532  = ~Anyway, next thing I know, you're holding up this dwarf with one hand, and I've got a half-orc polishing the tables with my head.~
@533  = ~It all got rather fuzzy after that... and I woke up here only a little while before you did.~
@534  = ~I held up a dwarf with one hand?~
@535  = ~Trust your clumsiness to get us into trouble.~
@536  = ~So, what are we supposed to do now?~
@537  = ~Well, I guess we'd better start looking for a way out.~
@538  = ~I guess there's nothing for us to do now but wait for a guard to come by and tell us how much it will cost to get out of here.~
@539  = ~This isn't like that jail in Baldur's Gate. I've counted at least three guards since I've been awake, and there's one right at the end of the hall. I doubt any of them will look a potential jailbreak with favor.~
@540  = ~My plans ended in a soft, warm bed, not in a jail cell.~
@541  = ~It was pretty amazing, though he deserved the pounding you gave him after he kissed you.~
@542  = ~He kissed me?!~
@543  = ~Did I look like I was enjoying it, at least?~
@544  = ~Remind me of this, next time you want to sit down for a couple of ales.~
@545  = ~How are we ever going to live this down?~
@546  = ~That part didn't surprise me.~
@547  = ~I have no idea how that happened. The half-orc had my head clamped under his armpit, so I couldn't see much.~
@548  = ~You didn't look like you minded all that much, or at least that's what I thought until you belted him. Maybe he was a bad kisser.~
@549  = ~Sorry for not defending your honor properly. I was having my head squeezed off by a half-orc at the time, so I was a bit busy.~
@550  = ~As near as I could tell. But then you hauled off and punched him, so he mustn't have been doing a very good job of it.~
@551  = ~Alright, ye louts, pay yer fee an' off with ye.~
@552  = ~What's the fee?~
@553  = ~I'm not being charged with anything?~
@554  = ~Why are we even here?~
@555  = ~About time.~
@556  = ~It's ten gold apiece... plus five on account o' your friend pukin' on th' warden.~
@557  = ~All right, here's your 25 gold.~
@558  = ~Gavin threw up on the warden?~
@559  = ~I'll give you ten gold. Gavin can stay here for a while and think about why he shouldn't do that again.~
@560  = ~I haven't got that much gold on me.~
@561  = ~Ye're bein' charged with drunk an' disorderly. Ye pays yer fine, ye're free.~
@562  = ~Don't ye be gettin' mouthy on me, or I'll lose th' key fer good. If ye're smart, ye'll just pays yer fine and walk away.~
@563  = ~Right. Stay out o' trouble, now, the both of ye.~
@564  = ~That 'e did, an' I had a hard time t' keep from laughin' at th' warden's face, let me tell ye. But ye still gotta pay yer fine afore I can let ye go.~
@565  = ~Suit yerself. Ye want t' get yer friend back, just go to th' Council o' Six buildin' an' give th' money to th' clerk.~
@566  = ~Off ye go now. Stay out o' trouble.~
@567  = ~Ah, I ain't bein' paid enough t' keep ye fer free, so I might as well just let ye go.~
@568  = ~If ye're a decent sort, ye'll stop by the clerk in th' Council o' Six buildin' afore too long an' pay 'im th' 25 gold ye owe, but I won't trouble meself t' track ye down.~
@569  = ~For what it's worth, I'm sorry about what happened.~ [bgav134]
@570  = ~It's alright, Gavin. I was right there with you, and it did seem like a good idea at the time.~
@571  = ~We all make mistakes. Forgive and forget.~
@572  = ~It won't happen again, will it?~
@573  = ~No more strong drink for you, ever.~
@574  = ~Maybe...~
@575  = ~Thanks for being so understanding.~
@576  = ~No, it most certainly won't.~
@577  = ~Looking back on it, that was still a really stupid thing for me to do. We already know there's somebody out there who's after you. We're lucky we only wound up in prison.~
@578  = ~Still, your kindness means much. Thank you.~
@579  = ~It's my turn to cook tonight, so I'm taking requests. What will it be?~ [bgav135]
@580  = ~[KORGAN] Venison steaks, rare and juicy.~
@581  = ~[VALYGAR] The meat's too tough. You'll have to stew it.~
@582  = ~[ANOMEN] Stew would be agreeable.~
@583  = ~[JAN] Especially with some tubers, and a turnip or two.~
@584  = ~[NALIA] No stew tonight, please. We've been eating it for days on end, and the bread's all gone stale.~
@585  = ~[VICONIA] Pfaugh! It all tastes like dust, anyway.~
@586  = ~[AERIE] I found some berries. We can have them afterward.~
@587  = ~[JAHEIRA] Those are chokeberries, girl. Eat them, and your guts will be cramping all night.~

@592  = ~[EDWIN] We could be dining in one of the finest eating houses in Athkatla, but no! We crouch beside a fire watching a baboon burn water.~
@593  = ~[MINSC] Hush, you! None of us will forget that mushy thing you made with boiled celery and that oily sauce.~
@594  = ~[EDWIN] That was celery remoulade, I will have you know, and it is a great delicacy in Thay. (How do I endure the cultural vacuum that exists among these cretins?)~
@595  = ~[CERND] As the swallow's diet changes over the course of its long journeys, so too must ours vary to include whatever is readily at hand.~
@596  = ~[KORGAN] Just don't ask me to eat what a swallow eats, an' we'll be gettin' on fine.~

@600  = ~[IMOEN] We could always put a peanut or two in Boo's portion.~

@602  = ~[CERND] It grows abundantly in these parts.~
@603  = ~[VICONIA] These camp meals have become so tedious! How I long for the delicate sauces and subtle spicing I am accustomed to!~
@604  = ~[NALIA] I guess you'd need it to make rat taste good.~
@605  = ~[VALYGAR] Whatever you're going to cook, you should do it quickly. This fire is going to draw unwelcome attention, if we let it burn much longer.~

@624  = ~I'm not about to test that theory.~
@625  = ~No thanks.~
@626  = ~I don't feel like talking.~
@627  = ~That's not true. I've got some batter made, and I was going to make dumplings, but if you'd rather have biscuits, I can cook them in a skillet, or if you want bread... well, you might be out of luck with the bread...~

@641  = ~Well, I'll never have to wonder who broke the crockery with you around.~
@642  = ~I thought I saw your mother last time we were in town, but then I realized one of the hippos had escaped from the menagerie.~
@643  = ~They say that a man's skill in the bedroom is about the same as his skill in the kitchen. No wonder Miranda left you.~

@651  = ~Aye, they do, but as insults go, that one was pretty weak.~
@652  = ~Not bad! I actually had to think about that one for a moment to figure out what you were talking about.~
@653  = ~So I'm told, but that wasn't very insulting at all.~
@654  = ~Good choice of subject matter, but it got a little trite toward the end.~
@655  = ~I bought most of it... or at least I think I did. It's been so long, I've forgotten. But as insults go, that didn't work very well, since it really isn't anything I care about.~
@656  = ~An excellent insult! Well done!~
@657  = ~I don't think I'm her type, bad jokes or not, but as insults go, it isn't bad.~
@658  = ~Solid imagery. I liked that one.~
@659  = ~Ah, yes, that one again. I'm afraid that joke's getting a little threadbare.~
@660  = ~Mothers are usually off limits, but in this case, I'll make an exception.~
@661  = ~Ouch, but I did say all is fair.~
@662  = ~Possibly true, but a good insult, nonetheless.~
@663  = ~Can't say I'd blame you there.~
@664  = ~Lucky goat!~
@665  = ~So it would seem.~
@666  = ~Ah well, it was worth a shot. Unfortunately, that's about all I've got for your amusement tonight, so maybe I'd better just let you get some rest. Sleep well, <CHARNAME>.~
@667  = ~Want to go again?~

@684  = ~(Moments later, Gavin approaches, his face bruised and bloodied.)~
@685  = ~What happened to you?~
@686  = ~Having fun, are we?~
@687  = ~It was all my fault. I wasn't watching where I was putting my feet and I stepped on the train of her dress. How was I to know the damned thing was made out of gauze? And what's the point of having a train on a dress that flimsy, anyway? Someone's bound to come along and step on it.~
@688  = ~And that someone is usually you.~
@689  = ~Oh, Gavin, you really do need to watch where you're going.~
@690  = ~So, I wonder if this means we'll be getting late-night knocks on our doors, or challenges from an irate husband, or maybe a fine *and* an angry husband.~

@694  = ~That was *not* something I planned.~
@695  = ~Usually, yes.~
@696  = ~Gods, I hope not! But I think she was too startled to get a really good look at me.~
@697  = ~Did she?~
@698  = ~Huh. I didn't know you enjoyed that. As for myself, I didn't notice.~
@699  = ~I was too busy watching my life flash before my eyes.~
@700  = ~I hope you aren't too disappointed in me.~
@701  = ~It was an accident.~
@702  = ~Hardly! You should have seen the look on her face!~
@703  = ~I wonder if there's any chance we can get out of here without drawing any more of a crowd.~
@704  = ~Discouraged, more than disappointed. I hoped that you would overcome your clumsiness eventually.~
@705  = ~They seem to happen to me a lot.~
@706  = ~Glad you're amused.~
@707  = ~Probably not.~
@708  = ~At this point, it's probably too late for that.~

@711  = ~Is that what you want?~

@724  = ~I think I'll just stay here.~

@740  = ~I'm sorry to excite you and then stop, but I think maybe we should just get some sleep.~

@868  = ~(Gavin's fears about his ability to restrain himself prove to be justified, but his satisfaction does not prevent him from attending your needs. By the time he rises to lie beside you once more, your passion is utterly spent and your appetite sated.)~
@869  = ~(He begins with languid ease, but before long, the urgency of your lovemaking overwhelms him. The pace becomes more frenzied, and he surrenders to his need for release mere heartbeats after your own desire is fulfilled.)~
@870  = ~(He stands at ease while your eyes survey his body, his usual modesty forgotten. He seems no more conscious of his nudity than a buck would be, and he meets your scrutiny with serene acceptance.)~
@871  = ~(Months of deprivation and hardship have taken their toll on Gavin. Muscular he remains, but any trace of softness about his abdomen or flanks is long gone, replaced by a sinewy leanness you don't remember seeing before.)~
@872  = ~You look fit, Gavin.~
@873  = ~It looks like we need to fatten you up.~
@874  = ~Why don't you move around a bit? Would you pose for me?~
@875  = ~What happened to 'shy Gavin'?~
@876  = ~(The months of deprivation Gavin endured while hunting for Lanie seem to have taken their toll. Muscular he remains, but any trace of softness about his abdomen or flanks has been replaced by a sinewy leanness.)~
@877  = ~I'm glad my body pleases you. Is there some use I can put it to?~
@878  = ~I might have lost a bit too much weight, but that will come back quickly enough once things quiet down. I hope you aren't too put off by the sight of me.~
@879  = ~No, not at all. You look fine.~
@880  = ~I'm finding the sight quite stimulating, actually.~
@881  = ~We all have our faults.~
@882  = ~I'm not sure I can go through with this, not after taking a good look at you. We'd better get some weight back on you first.~
@883  = ~<CHARNAME>, this isn't really the time or the place for a dance performance. Is there some other way I can entertain you?~
@884  = ~It's just you, me, and the trees, and the trees don't much care. Besides, the cool air feels good on my skin. Now, is there something I can do for you?~
@885  = ~So... now that I've got my clothes off, is there some other way I can entertain you?~
@886  = ~I'll try to gain some weight, but I don't know how easy it's going to be. We miss meals, march all day, fight when we need to... and I feel sluggish when I don't get the exercise I need. Maybe it would be better to just make sure you don't see me naked unless the lights are out.~
@887  = ~Anyway, I think this discussion has killed the mood for both of us. Let's just get some rest.~
@888  = ~Are you sure? It could be frightening.~
@889  = ~I can take it.~
@890  = ~Maybe it would be better if you were more gentle. Let's just take it slow.~
@891  = ~Oh, never mind. It would probably be better if we just got some rest.~
@892  = ~Oh, I have, have I? I'd better get on my knees and beg your forgiveness, then.~
@893  = ~That's a good start.~
@894  = ~Let's skip the groveling and go straight to atonement. Get down on all fours.~
@895  = ~I think I'll just send you to bed frustrated.~
@896  = ~(He shifts your garments more, exposing you to his touch. He strokes the delicate folds of your flesh for a moment or two, then he rises and positions himself between your thighs, his head level with your groin.)~
@897  = ~(He gently parts your secret lips and runs his tongue lightly over your most sensitive area.)~
@898  = ~Oh, yes, don't stop!~
@899  = ~(You let him get on with it.)~
@900  = ~No, Gavin, don't do that.~
@901  = ~No, but I never last when you do that.~
@902  = ~Why don't you just touch me instead?~
@903  = ~I don't enjoy that, Gavin. If that's what you had in mind, we'd better just go to sleep.~
@904  = ~Don't worry about that, <CHARNAME>. This is all for you, so take as much or as little time as you need.~
@905  = ~(With that, Gavin lowers himself to lie between your thighs and sets to work. His tongue moves over you until you give yourself over to ecstasy. At last, when all your desires are spent, he pulls himself up to lie beside you once more.)~
@906  = ~(He shifts your garments a little more, then slides his hand inside them.)~
@907  = ~Your wish is my command!~
@908  = ~(The intensity of his caress increases and you are swept away on a rising tide of your own desire. At last, your passion crests, and you return to the moment.)~
@909  = ~Alright, but if you start to feel uneasy at any point, just say the word and I'll back off.~
@910  = ~(He walks around you three times, never touching you, just inhaling the scent of your hair. He comes to a halt while he is standing behind you. He brusquely sweeps your hair away from your neck, then clamps his mouth on the exposed skin.)~
@911  = ~(His hands hold your arms firmly to your sides while he works on your neck. He might only be kissing you, though you often feel the brush of his teeth against your throat.)~
@912  = ~Mmm... yes...~
@913  = ~(You wait to see what he will do next.)~
@914  = ~Stop!~
@915  = ~Forgive me, my most lovely mistress! I repent myself of my wrongs, and sumbit myself willingly to your discipline.~
@916  = ~Bend over, Gavin, and prepare to receive the punishment that is your due.~
@917  = ~This is silly. Let's just make love... slowly.~
@918  = ~I can't do it, Gavin. It just feels so wrong!~
@919  = ~(Gavin lets down his leggings and drops so that he kneels with both elbows on the ground, his buttocks thurst high into the air. He waits silently for your next move.)~
@920  = ~(You slap his backside.)~
@921  = ~Oh, what a fine sight this is! How I wish I had a painter here to capture this moment!~
@922  = ~(He gasps as the flat of your hand strikes his bare flesh, but he remains where he is, braced to receive your next blow.)~
@923  = ~(You slap him again.)~
@924  = ~(You run your hand over his buttocks, then reach down between his legs to slide your hand over his testicles and manhood.)~
@925  = ~I'm glad you don't! This isn't exactly something I'd want my grandchildren to see. Are you going to do something, or do you intend to leave me like this?~
@926  = ~(His exclamation this time is more of a groan. The red marks of your recent blows are vivid against his fair skin, but he does not flinch, nor does he cry out in protest.)~
@927  = ~(You strike him again.)~
@928  = ~I can't do this anymore. It just feels wrong.~
@929  = ~Easy, there! You almost got my balls on that one!~
@930  = ~Are you enjoying this at all?~
@931  = ~(You correct your aim and hit him again.)~
@932  = ~It's... different. It's hard to explain, but it seems to be turning me on. Just watch the aim, alright?~
@933  = ~(The moan that follows your next blow has a throaty quality to it, and he shifts the line of his body slightly, bringing his pelvis closer to the ground.)~
@934  = ~(You slap his rump again, even harder than before.)~
@935  = ~Oh... <CHARNAME>... do it again...~
@936  = ~And again...~
@937  = ~(You slap his backside one more time.)~
@938  = ~Gods, yes...~
@939  = ~<CHARNAME>... I can't take anymore! I need you beneath me...~
@940  = ~Have you learned your lesson?~
@941  = ~(You hastily remove your clothing and lay down beside him.)~
@942  = ~I'm sorry, Gavin, but as much as this has excited you, it seems to have had the opposite effect on me.~
@943  = ~Yes! Anything! Just let me have you...~
@944  = ~Very well.~
@945  = ~Oh, no! None for you! A little frustration is good for you.~
@946  = ~(He shivers as your hand passes over the most sensitive parts of his body and he lets out his breath in a whoosh, as if he'd been holding it. Once you have your hands on him, however, you discover the reason for his reaction. He is completely aroused.)~
@947  = ~What do you want, Gavin?~
@948  = ~Are you ready?~
@949  = ~(You strip off your clothing and lie beside him.)~
@950  = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>!~
@951  = ~(He takes you swiftly. Though he tries to hold himself back, it soon becomes obvious that restraint is no longer possible for him. He tenses, cries out, and then falls gasping on top of you.)~
@952  = ~I take it you enjoyed that?~
@953  = ~Get off me, you big lug!~
@954  = ~Er... Gavin? What about me?~
@955  = ~(gulp) Gods, yes! But you...~
@956  = ~You can make it up to me next time.~
@957  = ~Your mouth still works, doesn't it?~
@958  = ~You still have the use of your hands, I think.~
@959  = ~This one's for you.~
@960  = ~Sorry! That was the most incredible... but you...~
@961  = ~Oh, gods... I am such an ass...~
@962  = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>, I was so selfish... but I will make it up to you next time, I swear it. Just give me a little while... so sleepy...~
@963  = ~Aye, just let me catch my breath...~
@964  = ~That *will* be torture.~
@965  = ~(With that, Gavin lowers himself to lie between your thighs and sets to work. His tongue moves over you, titillating your senses. Your excitement mounts, but he drives you onward. At last, your passion crests, and he withdraws, rising up to take you into his arms once more.)~
@966  = ~(His hands loosen their grip on your arms only to move to the fastenings of your clothing. With a few quick yanks and tugs, he exposes you to the world. He turns you to face him and buries his face against your breasts.)~
@967  = ~That's it, Gavin!~
@968  = ~You can do better than that!~
@969  = ~Easy, Gavin. Maybe we should take this slower.~
@970  = ~Stop. This is too much.~
@971  = ~That's right, <CHARNAME>. Don't let me do anything you don't want me to do. We need to both be alright with this, or I'd never be able to live with myself.~
@972  = ~Are you alright, or do you need a moment to compose yourself?~
@973  = ~I'm alright, Gavin. You were just a little too forceful. Let's try again, a little gentler and a lot slower.~
@974  = ~I'm alright, but I think we'd better not risk any more intimacy right now. Let's just get some rest, and we'll see what tomorrow brings.~
@975  = ~I'm a little rattled, but I'll be okay once I've had a chance to calm down a bit.~
@976  = ~Gavin, you were terrifying!~
@977  = ~It's alright, <CHARNAME>. If it isn't working for you, then it isn't working for me, either. Let's just hold each other for a while and get some rest.~
@978  = ~(His mouth locks on yours again and he drinks deeply of you. His kiss is hard, violent even, with little sign of his usual tenderness.)~
@979  = ~(His maimed left hand moves to your breast and he seizes it, pinching your nipple hard between his thumb and middle finger, while his right drops to your groin. He parts the folds of your flesh and plunges his fingers deep inside you.)~
@980  = ~Yes, Gavin, yes!~
@981  = ~Stop being such a sissy!~
@982  = ~No! Stop!~
@983  = ~(His left hand moves to your breast and he seizes it, pinching your nipple hard between his thumb and forefinger, while his right drops to your groin. He parts the folds of your flesh and plunges his fingers deep inside you.)~
@984  = ~Sorry, <CHARNAME>, I did warn you that it might be rougher than you wanted, but I'm glad you stopped me. We'll just hold each other while you calm down, and then we'll get some rest.~
@985  = ~I'm sorry! Oh, <CHARNAME>, I should have known better than to show you that side of me.~
@986  = ~You mean you're really like that? I thought it was an act!~
@987  = ~We all have darkness inside us, Gavin, but letting me see that much of yours might have been a bit unwise.~
@988  = ~No, I'm just as glad to know what you're capable of. You have got that under control, haven't you?~
@989  = ~It's alright, Gavin. You just caught me by surprise.~
@990  = ~No, I'm not like that... not at all. I do have dark thoughts, sometimes, but I would never have let you see that if you hadn't asked me to.~
@991  = ~Well, now I know. It wasn't even that bad, though it did catch me by surprise.~
@992  = ~I understand, Gavin, but I'd just as soon not see that hunger in your eyes ever again.~
@993  = ~I'm sorry, but this changes everything. I'm never going to be able to make love to you again without imagining that you're going to turn into a monster.~
@994  = ~Get away from me, beast!~
@995  = ~Yes, I see that now. Well, now that you know how savage I can be, I'll have to trust you not to ask me to to treat you like that again.~
@996  = ~Yes, absolutely. I never would have let you see me like that at all if you hadn't asked me to show you how aggressive I can be.~
@997  = ~I did warn you that it might be more than you wanted.~
@998  = ~Fair enough, but next time, I hope you'll know better than to ask me to show you how aggressive I can be.~
@999  = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>, I am sorry it has come to this, but I understand.~
@1000 = ~Well, I've certainly ruined everything, haven't I?~
@1001 = ~I'm sure that's put any thought of intimacy out of your mind, at least for now. It certainly has for me. Let's just hold each other until we calm down, and then get some rest.~
@1002 = ~Come on. I might as well walk you back to camp.~
@1003 = ~(He continues his attentions a few moments longer, then drops to the ground, pulling you after him. You find yourself on all fours, and he kneels behind you, one hand on the back of your neck. You feel him pressing against you.)~
@1004 = ~That's it! Give it to me now!~
@1005 = ~Be a man! Take what you want!~
@1006 = ~(He enters you with a savage thrust then pulls back, only to drive into you again and again. Then, after one last convulsive shudder, he is still. He falls to the ground beside you and draws you into his arms, looking anxiously at your face.)~
@1007 = ~Are you alright?~
@1008 = ~It's always the shy ones who surprise you. I had no idea you had that in you.~
@1009 = ~I will be, though I might walk funny for a while.~
@1010 = ~That was incredible... in a good way.~
@1011 = ~I can tell you enjoyed it, but it didn't do much for me, if you know what I mean.~
@1012 = ~It was terrifying.~
@1013 = ~I didn't know I had it in me, either. At least not to that extent...~
@1014 = ~Sorry about that. I guess I got carried away.~
@1015 = ~I'm glad you enjoyed it, but it scared the hells out of me, to be perfectly honest. I had no idea I could be so... violent.~
@1016 = ~But you did ask me to show you how aggressive I could be. I was unsure myself, but now I know. I feel drained, somehow... in more than a physical sense. I'd like to hold you for a while, if I can, and maybe get some rest.~
@1017 = ~Alone, at last.~ [bgav138]
@1018 = ~I've been waiting for you.~
@1019 = ~I thought you'd never get here.~
@1020 = ~Let's try something different.~
@1021 = ~I've started without you.~
@1022 = ~I'm a little tired, Gavin.~
@1023 = ~I hope I didn't keep you waiting long.~
@1024 = ~It felt like hours!~
@1025 = ~I forgive you... as long as you take off your clothes and join me at once.~
@1026 = ~I thought about sending down to the common room for a replacement, but decided against it.~
@1027 = ~You took too long. I've lost interest.~
@1028 = ~What a coincidence! I've been looking forward to this, as well.~
@1029 = ~So much for your dislike of casual affairs.~
@1030 = ~You've been looking forward to it, eh? How much?~
@1031 = ~You just can't get enough, can you?~
@1032 = ~If you're so eager, why are you still dressed?~
@1033 = ~Then you're really not going to like what I have to say. I've lost interest, I'm afraid.~
@1034 = ~Then let's get more comfortable, shall we?~
@1035 = ~You read my mind.~
@1036 = ~You're very eager, aren't you?~
@1037 = ~I was wondering if you'd ever get around to that part.~
@1038 = ~I've changed my mind. I'd rather be alone.~
@1039 = ~And planning the tortures you're going to inflict upon me, I don't doubt.~
@1040 = ~(giggle) Would I do that to you?~
@1041 = ~Of course! Just wait until you find out what I've got in store for you!~
@1042 = ~You know you love it.~
@1043 = ~I don't know, Gavin. It seems to me that the best torture would be to send you to bed unsatisfied.~
@1044 = ~No, actually. I've been waiting for you to show up so that I can tell you how exhausted I am.~
@1045 = ~I thought you might appreciate it if I took a bath before I came to your bed.~
@1046 = ~Aren't you considerate!~
@1047 = ~You bathed and then you dressed yourself again? We'll have to remedy that immediately!~
@1048 = ~That's fortunate, because I'd like to kiss you all over.~
@1049 = ~I wish you'd waited. We could have bathed together.~
@1050 = ~I'm sorry to have put you to the trouble. I'm not really in the mood anymore.~
@1051 = ~I refilled our water bottles. I thought we might be a little rushed when we wake up.~
@1052 = ~I'm a little rushed right now. I want your clothes off!~
@1053 = ~Looking forward to a little passion, are we?~
@1054 = ~We might be more rested than you think. I'm afraid that I'm just too tired for any exertion right now.~
@1055 = ~I thought you might want to sleep in a little tomorrow, so I picked up some bread and honey for our breakfast.~
@1056 = ~Just put them on the table over there and we'll see what we can do about getting you naked.~
@1057 = ~We'll save the bread, but I think we might have a use for some of that honey right now.~
@1058 = ~Sorry, Gavin, but I think I'd rather go to bed early than stay up late. I'm exhausted.~
@1059 = ~Sorry to have kept you waiting, but I wanted a shave. I'd hate to scratch your pretty face with my bristly chin.~
@1060 = ~My face can take it. Some of the more sensitive parts of my body, however, will be better off this way.~
@1061 = ~Would you let me shave you one of these days?~
@1062 = ~Oh? What did you have in mind?~
@1063 = ~I happened to pick up a little jar of honey when we were in the market and I thought we might be able to find some use for it.~
@1064 = ~With a feather and a little imagination, I'm sure we can think of something.~
@1065 = ~Can you think of anything we can do with four bedposts and four silk scarves?~
@1066 = ~Let's pretend it's the first time we've made love.~
@1067 = ~I want to see if you can hold my naked body the whole time we rest without trying anything.~
@1068 = ~I was hoping that you might have some ideas.~
@1069 = ~What? Are you bored with me already?~
@1070 = ~Hardly! But a little variety keeps things from getting stale.~
@1071 = ~We're in rut, Gavin. When we lie together, we do the same things over and over again.~
@1072 = ~There's no challenge anymore. You aren't trying to win my love, I'm no longer undecided about whether to accept you.~
@1073 = ~There's no challenge anymore.~
@1074 = ~Maybe I am. Maybe we need to invite someone else to join us.~
@1075 = ~I could never get bored with you! But let's not risk it.~
@1076 = ~I'm just making up for lost time. You didn't have much experience before you met me.~
@1077 = ~You are an adventurous little thing, aren't you?~
@1078 = ~What can I say? I like trying new things.~
@1079 = ~Things are getting a bit dull, to be honest with you. It seems like we're always doing exactly the same things.~
@1080 = ~We need to expand your horizons, don't we? After all, you were chaste before you met me.~
@1081 = ~Maybe. Do you have any recommendations?~
@1082 = ~I want to try an experiment. I want to see if you can hold my naked body the whole time we rest without getting aroused.~
@1083 = ~Whatever it is, I'm game.~
@1084 = ~So I see! And I must say that you look ravishing!~
@1085 = ~And you smell like soap. Does that mean what I think it means?~
@1086 = ~So let's not waste any more time. Take off your clothes and let's get to it.~
@1087 = ~You say the nicest things!~
@1088 = ~I'm in the mood to be adventurous. Let's try something new.~
@1089 = ~I don't know quite how to put this, but I started without you and I finished without you, too. Now I'm ready to sleep.~
@1090 = ~I hope I'm not too late!~
@1091 = ~No, but I'm eager for you to catch up. Let's just get those clothes off, shall we?~
@1092 = ~It's good that you showed up when you did. I was thinking about sending down to the common room for a replacement.~
@1093 = ~What took you? Don't you want me?~
@1094 = ~Let me just get rid of some of this clothing and I'll join you!~
@1095 = ~You smell like soap. Does that mean what I think it means?~
@1096 = ~Please do! Your clothes look much better on the floor, anyway.~
@1097 = ~A little eager, are we?~
@1098 = ~Very. Let's just get those clothes off, shall we?~
@1099 = ~I'm not surprised. Turn onto your belly and I'll rub your back.~
@1100 = ~That sounds wonderful.~
@1101 = ~Take it easy on me, Gavin. Last time, you were too rough.~
@1102 = ~No, I'm not really in the mood for that. Why don't you just hold me instead.~
@1103 = ~Sorry, but I just want some sleep. You'd better go back to your own room.~
@1104 = ~Would you like to be alone?~
@1105 = ~I'd really like a massage.~
@1106 = ~I'm still interested in making love to you, but I'd like to take it nice and slow.~
@1107 = ~I need sleep, but I don't want to be alone, either.~
@1108 = ~Sorry, but yes, I'd like to be alone.~
@1109 = ~Me, too, now that you mention it. What do you want to do?~
@1110 = ~I think that I'd like to be alone.~
@1111 = ~Too tired for company?~
@1112 = ~How about a massage?~
@1113 = ~I want company, but I do need rest.~
@1114 = ~Let's get to it at once!~
@1115 = ~(He hastily strips off his clothing, letting it lie wherever it falls.)~
@1116 = ~Oh, is this how it's going to be? It seems that I'm not so indispensible to you, after all! Why don't you tell me what services you would like from this mysterious other while I get rid of some of this clothing.~
@1117 = ~I want something different.~
@1118 = ~Nice, easy lovemaking sounds good.~
@1119 = ~Hmm. I might still send for that other person. It might be fun to have both of you at once.~
@1120 = ~Well, it would start with a massage...~
@1121 = ~You know I'm not serious, don't you?~
@1122 = ~Too late! You had your chance. Now I'm going to bed.~
@1123 = ~I'm sorry to hear that, but I understand if you want your rest. I'll get another room so I don't disturb you. Sleep well, <CHARNAME>.~
@1124 = ~As much as I wish things could have been different between us, I'm still human. No matter what your feelings for me are, I can't deny that I enjoy the physical aspects of our relationship as much as you do. It isn't exactly something I could hide even if I wanted to.~
@1125 = ~I won't deny it. I couldn't if I wanted to. You thrill me, <CHARNAME>, and I'm always eager to come to your bed.~
@1126 = ~Never... and that's fortunate, because you seem to enjoy it, too.~
@1127 = ~Let me think about this. Would you entice me, tempting me with your obvious charms? Yes, I believe you might.~
@1128 = ~You know I do.~
@1129 = ~You would deny me the chance to find comfort and relief in the arms of a beautiful woman? Oh, the cruelty! Still, I must abide by your decision, however much I suffer because of it.~
@1130 = ~Jesting aside, I'll live. Move over, then. If I can't have you in the flesh, I can still have you in my dreams.~
@1131 = ~I am always eager to please you, my lady! Speak, then, and tell me how.~
@1132 = ~I'm a little too tired, Gavin. Just hold me, and we can sleep.~
@1133 = ~I don't know, Gavin. I wanted you before, but now I just want to sleep... alone.~
@1134 = ~Baths are for getting clean, <CHARNAME>. Besides, with these legs, I sometimes have trouble fitting into a bathtub all by myself... and I sing while I bathe. You don't want to listen to that, do you?~
@1135 = ~You're making excuses.~
@1136 = ~We can still be in the same room!~
@1137 = ~Come on, it would be fun. I could scrub your back.~
@1138 = ~You're ruining my sport.~
@1139 = ~Won't that make a mess of the linens?~
@1140 = ~We'll be careful.~
@1141 = ~I'll risk it.~
@1142 = ~Where's your sense of adventure?~
@1143 = ~I'm sure the staff here is used to that kind of thing.~
@1144 = ~Good point.~
@1145 = ~I don't know... that razor is really sharp. I've shaved every day for my entire adult life and I still manage to cut myself from time to time. Scars might be manly, but I don't know if I want any new ones.~
@1146 = ~We don't have to do it for real. I could just soap up your face and use the back of the razor.~
@1147 = ~Don't you trust me?~
@1148 = ~Ah, well, it was a thought.~
@1149 = ~We definitely want those sensitive parts to be happy! How should we go about it?~
@1150 = ~This should be interesting. Which of us gets to hold the feather?~
@1151 = ~I'll be the one tickling you.~
@1152 = ~Why don't you tease me, for a change?~
@1153 = ~Forget the feather. Let's just make love.~
@1154 = ~On second thought, maybe we'd better just go to sleep.~
@1155 = ~Which of us is in need of restraint?~
@1156 = ~You are, of course!~
@1157 = ~You can tie me up, this time.~
@1158 = ~On second thought, I'd rather skip the playing around and get right to the lovemaking.~
@1159 = ~(A few moments later, Gavin is in bed with you, holding you gently. He smooths your hair away from your face and kisses you tenderly.)~
@1160 = ~(You return his kiss, letting your hands explore his body.)~
@1161 = ~(You pinch him playfully.)~
@1162 = ~Oh, no! I have a strange man in my bed, and he's making advances against my chastity! Whatever shall I do?~
@1163 = ~(You relax against the cushions and let him take you in his own time.)~
@1164 = ~Mmm. I'm sleepier than I thought. Can we save this for another time?~
@1165 = ~I have no suggestions to offer, I'm afraid. All I know about pleasing a woman, I've learned from you.~
@1166 = ~Well, we've got this pot of honey right there. We could probably think of something to do with that.~
@1167 = ~I've got a feather and some imagination. Are you interested?~
@1168 = ~People do get used to each other after a while, and the initial excitement does start to fade, but that doesn't mean that we have to resign ourselves to dull sex. Would you like to try something different?~
@1169 = ~What do you recommend?~
@1170 = ~I'm just as glad we're past all that. The uncertainty was killing me. I still want to please you, though, but you're going to have to tell me how.~
@1171 = ~No, there's no challenge. I gave up trying to pursue you when you told me that you didn't want what I had to offer. I still want to please you, though, but you're going to have to tell me how.~
@1172 = ~Someone else, eh? Would this be a male someone or a female someone?~
@1173 = ~I'd like to bring in another man.~
@1174 = ~I'd like to bring in another woman.~
@1175 = ~How about one of each?~
@1176 = ~Do you have a preference?~
@1177 = ~Maybe that isn't such a good idea.~
@1178 = ~You're right! You could be contributing something valuable to my education! So, in your opinion, what do I need to know?~
@1179 = ~They say that practice makes perfect, so let's just go over the basics.~
@1180 = ~(Gavin's hands are strong, but his touch is gentle. He begins by lightly kneading your whole back, carefully avoiding direct contact with any knots or sore spots. The first phase relaxes you, letting you grow accustomed to his touch and easing away the surface tension so he can work on the problem areas without causing you additional discomfort.)~
@1181 = ~You're going to have to try harder than that if you're going to work the kinks out of this back.~
@1182 = ~You don't have to be so cautious, Gavin. I know that working out the knots might hurt a bit.~
@1183 = ~That feels too good. I think you're going to have to make love to me now.~
@1184 = ~Keep that up and I'll fall asleep!~
@1185 = ~Lay your cheek against my shoulder, and I'll still be here when it's time to rise.~
@1186 = ~So, how would you like me to please you?~
@1187 = ~I know. Nobody can be serious all the time.~
@1188 = ~<CHARNAME>, the truth is that I just don't like the idea of anyone watching me bathe. We all need our private time while we attend matters of hygiene, and bathtime is one of mine.~
@1189 = ~(He takes the honey from you and dribbles a little of it onto your breast. He licks it off slowly, paying special attention to your nipple.)~
@1190 = ~I think I could learn to like this!~
@1191 = ~The other side wants some attention, too.~
@1192 = ~Lower...~
@1193 = ~It's no use. I know you're trying, but I can't seem to get in the mood.~
@1194 = ~Good thing I had the foresight to bring my pack in with me. Here's the razor. Be careful you don't cut yourself. The edge is very sharp.~
@1195 = ~(He reaches for a towel, then seats himself in a chair and waits patiently while you rub the soap into a frothy lather and apply it to his chin and cheeks. When you are done, he guides you to sit on his knees, facing him.)~
@1196 = ~(You carefully run the back of the blade over his cheek in long, even strokes.)~
@1197 = ~(You run the back of the blade over his face in short strokes, wiping the soap off the blade after every one.)~
@1198 = ~(You ignore his warnings and proceed to shave him for real, using the sharp edge of the blade.)~
@1199 = ~(You set the razor aside and unlace his shirt instead.)~
@1200 = ~Of course I trust you, but this is my face we're talking about...~
@1201 = ~Oh, hells, why not? The bleeding always stops eventually.~
@1202 = ~(He reaches for a towel, then seats himself in a chair and waits nervously while you rub the soap into a frothy lather and apply it to his chin and cheeks. When you are done, he guides you to sit on his knees, facing him.)~
@1203 = ~(You carefully run the blade over his cheek in long, even strokes.)~
@1204 = ~(You run the blade over his face in short strokes, wiping the soap off the blade after every one.)~
@1205 = ~This is well and good, but maybe I could shave someplace a little lower.~
@1206 = ~(He makes some adjustments, then lies naked on the bed, waiting to see what you will do.)~
@1207 = ~(You brush his nipple with the feather.)~
@1208 = ~(You tickle his chin.)~
@1209 = ~(You choose a more direct approach, and tease his groin with the feather.)~
@1210 = ~(You put the feather aside and lie beside him.)~
@1211 = ~(He smiles and takes the feather, then waits while you remove your clothing and position yourself on the bed. Once you are settled, he kneels beside you, then tentatively brushes the underside of your chin with the feather.)~
@1212 = ~That tickles! But don't stop!~
@1213 = ~(You reach out and run your hand up the inside of his thigh.)~
@1214 = ~(You take the feather away from him and pat the bed beside you.)~
@1215 = ~(He makes a few preparations, then lies on the bed, spreading his arms and legs wide. He offers no protest while you secure him, though he does squirm a bit when you are done, as if testing the knots.)~
@1216 = ~(You stroke his torso.)~
@1217 = ~(You tickle his exposed armpits.)~
@1218 = ~(You run your hands down his body and set to work on his groin until his manhood springs to life.)~
@1219 = ~What would you do if I left you like this?~
@1220 = ~(He looks skeptical, but he obeys, loosely tying your wrists and ankles to the bedposts with the scarves. The knots aren't tight, and you could probably pull free easily enough.)~
@1221 = ~Remind me never to let you handle the knots, if we ever have to take any prisoners.~
@1222 = ~So, what tortures do you have in mind?~
@1223 = ~Do you like having me at your mercy?~
@1224 = ~I don't like this!~
@1225 = ~Mmm. That feels so good... you're making it hard for me to restrain myself.~
@1226 = ~Don't.~
@1227 = ~Slow down, Gavin. Don't you want this to last?~
@1228 = ~You've never been good at self-control.~
@1229 = ~It feels good to me, too.~
@1230 = ~I'm sorry, Gavin, but I just don't have the energy for this.~
@1231 = ~Ooh! Well, that certainly got my attention!~
@1232 = ~Does it excite you?~
@1233 = ~I want you, Gavin. Now.~
@1234 = ~Easy! We don't want you finishing too soon, do we?~
@1235 = ~You should surrender at once, of course!~
@1236 = ~I think I will.~
@1237 = ~If you want me, you'll have to take me by force.~
@1238 = ~You'll have to work harder than that if you want the favors I offer!~
@1239 = ~I don't think so! A little frustration never hurt anyone.~
@1240 = ~I think I'll just hold you instead. We can make love another night.~
@1241 = ~(Without another word, he obeys. He loves you long and tenderly, but nothing can really last forever, not even pleasure. When you both lie spent at last, he takes you into his arms again, and you fall asleep with the warmth of his body enveloping you.)~
@1242 = ~I hate to disappoint you, but I could not bear to watch another man take you. I cannot allow it.~
@1243 = ~Are you afraid that you wouldn't measure up?~
@1244 = ~Relax, Gavin, I wasn't serious.~
@1245 = ~Why do you feel that way?~
@1246 = ~You might enjoy it.~
@1247 = ~What would you have said if I told you I wanted a woman?~
@1248 = ~Oh, alright. Never mind.~
@1249 = ~I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I could not bear to watch you and another woman together. I cannot allow it.~
@1250 = ~Are you afraid that you wouldn't measure up to her expectations?~
@1251 = ~What would you have said if I told you I wanted a man?~
@1252 = ~What we do is private, <CHARNAME>, not some spectacle for others to enjoy. And if you wanted someone else to touch you in my presence... I cannot allow it.~
@1253 = ~Aye, I most certainly do! I want there to be two people involved, you, me, and no one else.~
@1254 = ~Why? Are you insecure about your body?~
@1255 = ~(He focuses his attention on the knots, now. It might be painful at first, but by the time he is done, you feel utterly relaxed.)~
@1256 = ~That was wonderful. Now how about some loving?~
@1257 = ~Let's see what else you can do with those talented hands.~
@1258 = ~I feel much better now... and energetic enough to try something naughty.~
@1259 = ~So sleepy...~
@1260 = ~Don't fight it, <CHARNAME>. If you need sleep, you need sleep.~
@1261 = ~With incentive like this, I could develop quite a sweet tooth!~
@1262 = ~(He eagerly repeats the procedure on your other breast, lavishing attention upon it. His own excitement is readily apparent.)~
@1263 = ~You aren't done yet, Gavin.~
@1264 = ~You need to go lower.~
@1265 = ~I need you. Now.~
@1266 = ~It's no use. I'm just not as excited by this as I hoped I would be. We should probably just get some sleep.~
@1267 = ~(He gets up off the bed and repositions you so that your hips are at the edge of the mattress. He gently parts your legs, drizzles a little more honey where they join, and then laps that up, too. The last of the honey is gone, but he continues to caress you with his lips and tongue.)~
@1268 = ~Yes! Don't stop!~
@1269 = ~Take me, Gavin!~
@1270 = ~Stop! It tickles!~
@1271 = ~What a miserable lover I turned out to be, eh?~
@1272 = ~Oops! If ever you're going to do this for real, you're going to have to take shorter strokes, otherwise the soap drips onto my chest.~
@1273 = ~We'll just have to remove your shirt now, won't we?~
@1274 = ~Right. Shorter strokes.~
@1275 = ~This is no fun. Maybe I could shave someplace a little lower.~
@1276 = ~You do fine work! If ever you decided to open your own shop, you'd have men lining up for one of your shaves.~
@1277 = ~So, will you let me be your personal barber?~
@1278 = ~Were you nervous?~
@1279 = ~So, now that I'm so good at this, maybe I could shave someplace a little lower.~
@1280 = ~I said to use the blunt edge, <CHARNAME>, not the sharp side! Since you're determined to do this, though, I don't suppose there's any point in trying to stop you.~
@1281 = ~Ouch! That's enough of that for one day. How bad is it?~
@1282 = ~It's barely scratched.~
@1283 = ~It's pretty bad. It looks like it might leave a scar.~
@1284 = ~You're making a big deal over nothing. Here, I'll kiss it better.~
@1285 = ~So, I guess this means you won't be interested in seeking any other kind of pleasure, doesn't it?~
@1286 = ~Something tells me that shaving me isn't foremost in your mind right now.~
@1287 = ~I want you, Gavin.~
@1288 = ~No, I still want to shave you. I just had someplace lower in mind.~
@1289 = ~Maybe I just want to cuddle.~
@1290 = ~Shorter strokes, please. You'll slice up my jaw if you go on like that.~
@1291 = ~You want to shave me THERE? <CHARNAME>, I must protest! What if you cut me? Besides, it will itch like hells.~
@1292 = ~Please? It will make some of the things we do so much more pleasant. I'll be careful, I promise.~
@1293 = ~I insist. Besides, you'll like it when it's done.~
@1294 = ~You can always heal up any nicks or scratches, right?~
@1295 = ~Oh, all right, have it your own way. But you'd better make it up to me in bed.~
@1296 = ~Forget it, then. And since you're going to be that way, you can go sleep in your own room.~
@1297 = ~No. Absolutely not. There is no way in hells I'm letting a razor anywhere near that part of my body, and that's my last word on the subject.~
@1298 = ~Oh! <CHARNAME>, that feels... incredible.~
@1299 = ~(You tickle his chin with the feather.)~
@1300 = ~(You stroke his groin with the feather.)~
@1301 = ~Are you ready for me?~
@1302 = ~I'm trying to be excited by this, but it isn't working. Maybe we'd better just stop.~
@1303 = ~Hehe... you can be more daring with that feather than that!~
@1304 = ~(You brush the feather across his nipple.)~
@1305 = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>! YES! Please... let me take you now!~
@1306 = ~I'll be the one doing the taking here!~
@1307 = ~I think you need a little more attention with the feather.~
@1308 = ~No, I think it would be more entertaining to leave you like that... for me, at least.~
@1309 = ~Right. No more feather. Would you rather have something more direct?~
@1310 = ~A feather just doesn't seem to be doing it for me. I think I need something a little firmer.~
@1311 = ~Let's stop playing games. Take me, Gavin.~
@1312 = ~(He teases your nipple with the feather... then trails it along your body until he reaches your groin.)~
@1313 = ~I think you're going to need to use something firmer than a feather there.~
@1314 = ~(You open your legs and wait to see what he'll do next.)~
@1315 = ~No feather, eh? Would you rather have something more direct?~
@1316 = ~(His breath catches and his breathing deepens as he becomes visibly aroused. He closes his eyes and turns his head away, as if reluctant to face you in his current state.)~
@1317 = ~Don't you like it?~
@1318 = ~Let me see what we have down here. Yes, I think your groin could do with a little attention, don't you?~
@1319 = ~Aren't you a fine sight! What would you do if I walked out and left you tied to the bed in this state?~
@1320 = ~(He gasps and squirms, but his protests do little to hide his excitement. He turns his face away from you, though, as if he finds his current state embarrassing in some way.)~
@1321 = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>! Yes... YES!~
@1322 = ~Do you want it?~
@1323 = ~I think I'll just rub you a little longer.~
@1324 = ~You should see yourself, Gavin! I don't think I've ever seen you this roused!~
@1325 = ~You wouldn't! <CHARNAME>, can't you see that I'm a man in need?~
@1326 = ~Oh, alright. Do you like it when I touch you down here?~
@1327 = ~I'd never do that to you. I would tease you some more, though.~
@1328 = ~Maybe I'll just get on top of you. You'd like that, wouldn't you?~
@1329 = ~You'll live. Besides, I didn't tie the knots that tight. You should be able to free yourself by tomorrow.~
@1330 = ~I don't want you to feel threatened.~
@1331 = ~You're missing the point.~
@1332 = ~You're really not comfortable tying me up, are you?~
@1333 = ~I want to be completely at your mercy.~
@1334 = ~Let's carry on, then.~
@1335 = ~I'm already feeling kind of threatened.~
@1336 = ~(He begins to stroke you, running his hands along your flanks, but he stops before he's done more than touch you.)~
@1337 = ~I can't do this. I'm sorry. I wouldn't have minded if it was you tying me up, but this way... I feel like I'm taking you against your will, and I can't accept that. I've got to untie you right now.~
@1338 = ~It's alright, Gavin, you don't have to do it if it's making you uncomfortable. Let's take a step back and make love to each other slowly.~
@1339 = ~Well, if you don't mind being tied up, I don't mind doing it. Let's change places.~
@1340 = ~If you don't want to do it my way, you can go to bed unsatisfied.~
@1341 = ~Easy, Gavin. Don't let this upset you. Here, lie beside me and we'll just hold each other.~
@1342 = ~I'll untie you at once! I'm glad you let me stop. I don't think I could have gone through with it anyway. It would have been different if it were me getting tied up, but since it was you... I just couldn't do it.~
@1343 = ~It really is better this way. Let's just take a step back and make love to each other slowly.~
@1344 = ~I think that maybe we're both too upset to take this any further. Lie beside me and we'll just hold each other.~
@1345 = ~(His hands move over your body, caressing you, coaxing you to greater and greater arousal. Unsurprisingly, it seems to be having the same effect on him.)~
@1346 = ~<CHARNAME>, please, I don't know how much longer I can wait.~
@1347 = ~Take me, then.~
@1348 = ~I want it, Gavin, and I want it rough.~
@1349 = ~You're going to have to wait, Gavin. In fact, I think I'll just send you to bed unsatisfied.~
@1350 = ~No, <CHARNAME>, I haven't.~
@1351 = ~(For a moment, he looks as if he might refuse, but then he responds to your order, seizing one wrist in each hand and parting your thighs with one knee. He enters you swiftly, relentlessly driving himself into your body. This is a pace he cannot long sustain, however. The rhythm soon falters and he cries out once before falling to the bed beside you, spent.)~
@1352 = ~That was certainly exhilarating!~
@1353 = ~Oh, no you don't! No rest for you until I'm satisfied, too!~
@1354 = ~I'm not even going to ask if it was good for you.~
@1355 = ~So, how long before you can go again?~
@1356 = ~I'll sleep well tonight, that much is certain.~
@1357 = ~Well, at least one of us is happy. Go ahead and sleep. I know you need it.~
@1358 = ~You have no idea. Or maybe you would, if you moved your hand a little lower down. Are you ready?~
@1359 = ~I need a little more attention if I'm going to be as ready as you.~
@1360 = ~Take me. Hard.~
@1361 = ~I'm ready, Gavin.~
@1362 = ~No, I know I've got nothing to be ashamed of.~
@1363 = ~Maybe I'm selfish, but if somebody's going to be giving you pleasure, I want it to be me. I don't want to see you writhing under someone else's touch, and I don't want to hear you calling out someone else's name in a moment of passion. It's probably a failing, but I am what I am.~
@1364 = ~Alright, then, how about you show me some of that passion?~
@1365 = ~Well, this little talk has been enough to make me lose interest, that's for sure.~
@1366 = ~That's a relief.~
@1367 = ~My answer would have been the same.~
@1368 = ~(After the last waves of your pleasure subside, Gavin lifts you and puts you back in the center of the bed, then lies down beside you. His arms close around you, and he eases your cheek to rest in the hollow of his shoulder.)~
@1369 = ~What about you, Gavin?~
@1370 = ~That was magnificent.~
@1371 = ~Hmm. I could very easily go to sleep right now. Do you want to rest?~
@1372 = ~(He stands and raises your legs to rest against his chest. His free hand caresses you while he seeks your opening. Still stroking you, he presses himself into you, moving slowly and breathing very, very deeply. You move together for a time, until you can no longer ignore your body's demands. Pleasure and relief wash over you. When you are spent, your gaze falls on Gavin's face, which is set in a slightly comical look of intense concentration. A moment later, he too is spent. He sinks to lie beside you on the bed.)~
@1373 = ~That was wonderful.~
@1374 = ~We should do that more often.~
@1375 = ~What should I do?~
@1376 = ~Take me, Gavin.~
@1377 = ~I think I'll just send you to bed unsatisfied.~
@1378 = ~I'll think about it. For now, though, I thought you might have certain needs to attend.~
@1379 = ~At first, but I relaxed once I realized you were doing so well. But you didn't call me here to shave me.~
@1380 = ~No, it doesn't feel too bad. Before we got distracted, I think that certain of your needs required attention.~
@1381 = ~Well, they say that scars make a man look distinguished. I'm not going to waste a healing spell on it. Or maybe I should. You have certain needs I need to attend, don't you?~
@1382 = ~The thought of you kissing my bloody face is enough to put me off my purpose in being here. You wanted me to see to your needs, didn't you?~
@1383 = ~I'm still interested if you are.~
@1384 = ~(Gavin looks anxious, but he quickly divests himself of his clothing and lies on the bed. He spreads his legs to allow you to sit between them, but his gaze is fixed firmly on the ceiling and both of his hands clench the bedding.)~
@1385 = ~Relax, Gavin. I won't hurt you.~
@1386 = ~(You begin to apply the lather to his groin.)~
@1387 = ~Oh, let's just forget it. Just put your arms around me and we'll go to bed.~
@1388 = ~Well, that just killed any interest I might have had in the procedure.~
@1389 = ~(He remains perfectly still as you settle yourself astride him, but comes alive again as you start to move. All his energy seems focused on pleasing you, but at last, his back arches, his grip on your hips tightens, and he tenses, then abruptly relaxes.)~
@1390 = ~No, <CHARNAME>, I don't think I can take much more.~
@1391 = ~Then we'll have to see what we can do to ease your suffering.~
@1392 = ~I think it would be more entertaining to leave you like that... for me, at least.~
@1393 = ~I think I've got just the right tool for the job.~
@1394 = ~I like it more than I ever imagined I would, and it's a little embarrassing.~
@1395 = ~Well, then, I think your groin could do with a little attention, don't you?~
@1396 = ~(He struggles briefly against the silken restraints, but succeeds only in tightening them.)~
@1397 = ~<CHARNAME>, untie me, please, for pity's sake.~
@1398 = ~It's only silk, Gavin. You can pull yourself free if you try hard enough.~
@1399 = ~Maybe I'll send in a maid to untie you later... if I remember.~
@1400 = ~Oh, very well. But you're sleeping alone tonight.~
@1401 = ~For both of us. Let's just scoot up the bed a little more and put the blanket over us. I think we'll both sleep soundly now.~
@1402 = ~(A short while later, you are done, and Gavin's groin is completely hairless. Perhaps it was the alien sensation of steel against his flesh, or the softness of the soap bubbles, but he is comletely roused by the time you are done.)~
@1403 = ~Hmm. That wasn't too bad, but you called me in here for a reason, didn't you?~
@1404 = ~(He strains against his bonds as you settle yourself astride him, but eventually stops struggling and gives himself over to the pleasure growing between you. He bucks his hips in time with your movements, and before long, you are both panting, satisfied.)~
@1405 = ~Very, very good... but not so for you, I take it.~
@1406 = ~I can rise again, I think, but I'm going to need a moment.~
@1407 = ~(He embraces you quietly for a while, but true to his word, his interest soon returns.)~
@1408 = ~Are you still interested, or would you rather just go to sleep?~
@1409 = ~I'm still interested.~
@1410 = ~I think that maybe we should just go to bed.~
@1411 = ~Did you enjoy that as much as I did?~
@1412 = ~Maybe more.~
@1413 = ~I do believe I did.~
@1414 = ~Maybe, but I think I'll need a repeat performance to be sure.~
@1415 = ~Sorry, but it wasn't as good for me as I hoped it would be.~
@1416 = ~I'm glad I was able to make you happy.~

@1419 = ~Is this where we're going to camp?~ [bgav139]
@1420 = ~It looked like a good spot to me. Would you rather camp somewhere else?~
@1421 = ~This is where we'll put most of the bedrolls, yes, but maybe we can put ours a little further away.~
@1422 = ~About what we discussed earlier, it might be better to wait until we have more privacy.~
@1423 = ~If that's what you want. Let's still put our bedrolls next to each other so I can hold you until it's my turn to get up and watch.~
@1424 = ~Maybe we should put ours away from the others just a bit. At least we'd have the illusion of privacy.~
@1425 = ~Good idea.~
@1426 = ~I've changed my mind. It might be better to wait until we have more actual privacy.~
@1427 = ~(Gavin places his bedroll beside yours before covering you both with the same blanket.

@1428 = ~(Once he feels your breathing deepen, he eases his hand under your loosened clothing and begins to run his fingertips over your breast.)~
@1429 = ~(You run your hands over his body.)~

@1435 = ~(If Gavin flinches at the touch of your lips on his skin, you sense that it is the result of his rising excitement. His touch becomes bolder.)~

@1460 = ~(Gavin makes no protest as you position yourself along his body. His hands grip your hips and he presses you downward until you feel him pressing against your threshold.

@1465 = ~We're going to need to get up in a few hours.~
@1466 = ~You got a bit rough there, at the end. Easy on the blankets!~
@1467 = ~Aye, you may be right. It's hard to keep track of the time, but it's always morning somewhere.~
@1468 = ~Aye, so it's best to rest up while you can.~
@1469 = ~Sorry. I felt myself beginning to cry out, and that certainly wouldn't be good, considering where we are.~
@1470 = ~Well, my watch starts soon, so I might as well stay awake. You rest while you can, and I'll wake you when it's time.~
@1471 = ~<CHARNAME>, there's something we need to talk about, now that things between us have... changed. We need to make sure that our lovemaking doesn't have unintended consequences.~ [bgav140]

@1475 = ~If it happens, it happens. We're both mature enough to raise children.~
@1476 = ~No, this would not be a good time to bring a child into this world.~
@1477 = ~That's good. I'm not sure I'm ready for parenthood.~
@1478 = ~That's good. I don't really want children, anyway.~
@1479 = ~I do want children, very much, but that doesn't blind me to the necessity of waiting.~
@1480 = ~No, <CHARNAME>, not forever. When your quest is done and our lives are more settled, I'll give you as many children as I'm able, or as many as you choose to bear, but right now, we need to wait.~
@1481 = ~I'm flattered that you'd want any of my get, but I can't. Not when I don't know if I'll be in your life to raise them. I'm sorry, but I'm just not that irresponsible.~
@1482 = ~I'm sure we are, but that isn't my reason for waiting.~
@1483 = ~No, it certainly would not.~
@1484 = ~Then it's even more important that we're careful.~
@1485 = ~Your quest is unfinished, and you face an adversary more powerful than either of us can even comprehend. It takes full commitment from both parents to raise a child, and neither of us can make that promise.~
@1486 = ~In some ways, this may be harder for me to accept than it is for you. Lathander commands his servants to be fruitful of mind and body, and here I am, refusing to father a child with the one woman in all the Realms who holds my heart.~
@1487 = ~This is no easier for me to accept than it is for you. Lathander commands his servants to be fruitful of mind and body, and here I am, refusing to father a child with the one woman in all the Realms who holds my heart... and a woman who feels the same way I do about children.~
@1488 = ~We do have choices. There is an herb I can take that would allow me to... er... perform my duties, but would leave me incapable of getting you with child. It's called cassil herb, and you'll find old wives and herbalists selling it all over Toril. I can even gather it myself in the Wilds, should the need arise.~
@1489 = ~Or you can leave that up to me and I'll make sure we never run out.~
@1490 = ~I'd like you to take care of it, Gavin.~
@1491 = ~You're the one who doesn't want children, so it should be your responsibility to make sure it doesn't happen.~
@1492 = ~Do you have any idea who would stock such an herb?~
@1493 = ~Thank you for letting me know. I'll be on the lookout for it.~
@1494 = ~What happens if we run out?~
@1495 = ~Fair enough. You'll never have to hear about it again.~
@1496 = ~Any herbalist would carry it. I know I saw one on the top tier of Waukeen's Promenade, up two flights of steps from the Den of the Seven Vales. There was another on the roof of the Copper Coronet, on the opposite side from the temple. I'm sure there are more.~
@1497 = ~I'll just have to find some other way to make you happy, won't I?~
@1498 = ~I... I'm here. Why am I here?~ [bgav141]
@1499 = ~You were dead, Gavin. You've been resurrected.~

@1504 = ~I'm wondering that myself.~
@1505 = ~Oh, no... but...~
@1506 = ~'Reanimated'... that would mean...~
@1507 = ~For me to be... alive... when I know I should be dead, it would mean that my work here is not done.~
@1508 = ~The Morninglord must still have some use for me. I don't know whether to be relieved or disturbed by this.~
@1509 = ~Well, if there's work to do, we should be about it. Thank you, <CHARNAME>, for allowing me to perceive the will of my god more clearly.~
@1510 = ~You're pretty banged up, there, <CHARNAME>! Can I take a look at that?~ [bgav142]
@1511 = ~Alright, but watch where you're putting those hands.~
@1512 = ~It's barely worth worrying about. I'll be fine.~
@1513 = ~Please do. These wounds will only slow us down.~
@1514 = ~Shut up and pass me a potion.~
@1515 = ~I'd rather have Viconia do it, if you know what I mean.~

@1537 = ~Don't worry, I won't be putting them anywhere I don't need to put them to treat your injuries.~

@1541 = ~Are you reluctant to touch me?~
@1542 = ~I understand. You aren't the first patient to be a little snappish with me. Would you like me to do something about your injuries?~
@1543 = ~Don't waste a spell on me. Bandaging is fine.~
@1544 = ~I know it isn't. I'm only concerned about aggravating your injuries further. Would you like me to tend them?~
@1545 = ~I don't want to aggravate your injuries, if that's what you mean.~
@1546 = ~I just wondered if there was more to it than that.~
@1547 = ~I meant, are you reluctant to touch me because you find me repulsive in some way?~
@1548 = ~Well, my injuries hurt like hells, so thanks for that.~
@1549 = ~No, that's all. Let me just take a look at that, now.~
@1550 = ~Er... are you asking me if I'm attracted to men?~
@1551 = ~Yes.~
@1552 = ~And if I was?~
@1553 = ~No, I just wondered if I offended you in some way.~
@1554 = ~No, I'm not. I'm not offended by the question, but my inclinations just don't run that way. Now, shall I have a look at your wounds?~
@1555 = ~I'd say that there's no harm in asking, but I'd also tell you that my inclinations don't run that way. Now, shall I have a look at your wounds?~
@1556 = ~No, you've certainly done nothing that would make me reluctant to treat your injuries. Shall I have look at them?~
@1557 = ~I wouldn't push myself too hard, if I were you. Healing only takes a moment, and injuries slow you down. Besides, there's no telling when we'll be attacked again.~
@1558 = ~A wise decision. Let me just have a look at that now.~
@1559 = ~I'm not sure that's a good idea. We have time now to cast spells and bandage injuries. We might not later. It's better to save the potions for when we're out of spells and out of other options.~
@1560 = ~She's healing your injuries, not teaching you drow pleasure techniques, but if you'd rather she did it, I've no complaints.~
@1561 = ~Well, her hands are certainly smaller, I'll give you that.~
@1562 = ~Er... yes, I imagine she is rather used to getting her way.~
@1563 = ~I've treated my share, and farm injuries and animal bites, as well, but if you think he's more able to cast healing spells, I won't stop you.~
@1564 = ~He always struck me as more in tune with animal lore than healing, but if you want him to treat you, I won't stop you.~
@1565 = ~I'll be gentle, I promise, and I won't touch you any more than I have to in order to treat your injuries.~
@1566 = ~You don't find me repulsive, do you?~
@1567 = ~No, I'm capable of maintaining my detchment... er...~
@1568 = ~Gods, no. If you weren't hurt, I'd be happy to... but you are hurt, so let's see what we can do about that.~
@1569 = ~No, that's all.~
@1570 = ~You should know better than to ask that. But you're hurt, and your wounds need attention.~
@1571 = ~No, that's all there is to it.~
@1572 = ~Gods, no... I mean, I'm perfectly able to maintain my detachment... er...~
@1573 = ~Never think that, love, never. But you are hurt, so let's see what we can do about that.~

@1580 = ~Just tell me who to treat first.~
@1581 = ~I've tended my share. I've also treated farm injuries, animal bites, a variety of interesting rashes, and once, a self-inflicted crushing injury to... well, a very sensitive part of the body. Don't ask.~
@1582 = ~I'd still rather have Anomen do it.~
@1583 = ~Now I HAVE to ask.~
@1584 = ~It involved two crates of nails, a block of wet soap, and an impatient wife. And to forestall your next question, it wasn't me... though that's probably only because I've never been married.~
@1585 = ~So do you trust me to treat your injuries or not?~
@1586 = ~<CHARNAME>, I'm surprised. After what we went through in the past, I wouldn't expect you to doubt my abilities.~
@1587 = ~I wouldn't be too sure of that, if I were you, but if you want Anomen to do it, I'm not going to stop you.~
@1588 = ~I've never had difficulty with that before, but if you want Anomen to do it, fine.~
@1589 = ~I can keep my mind on my work! I can be perfectly detached, when I need to be, though I'm not so sure Anomen could say the same.~
@1590 = ~I can keep my mind on my work! I can be perfectly detached, when I need to be.~
@1591 = ~I don't know, love. The way he's been, lately, I'm not so sure about that. And you should know me well enough by now to know that my mind wouldn't start wandering until after I'd tended your wounds.~
@1592 = ~You should know me well enough by now to know that my mind wouldn't start wandering until after I'd tended your wounds.~
@1593 = ~What's done is done, <CHARNAME>, but your wounds need attention now. Besides, I'm not so sure Anomen is as detached as you think he is.~
@1594 = ~What's done is done, <CHARNAME>, but your wounds need attention now.~
@1595 = ~If I even was entertaining thoughts like that, it wouldn't be while you're hurt. Besides, I'm not sure Anomen is as detached as you think he is.~
@1596 = ~If I even was entertaining thoughts like that, it wouldn't be while you're hurt.~
@1597 = ~I'm not going to argue with you about that. I'm not that stupid.~
@1598 = ~I doubt it, but if that's your choice, so be it.~
@1599 = ~I doubt that! I've treated my share of battle injuries, and farm accidents and animal bites, besides. But if you want him treating you... well, what can I say?~
@1600 = ~I'm not so sure about that. I've treated my share of battle injuries, and farm accidents and animal bites, besides. But it's your choice.~
@1601 = ~Is that really what you think? Anomen? Oh, love, I really have my doubts about him, but if it's what you want to do, I'm not going to stop you.~
@1602 = ~Is that really what you think? Anomen? Well, if that's what you think, that's what you think.~
@1603 = ~Ah, yes. Anomen. Well, go on, then.~
@1604 = ~I guess I can't do anything right. Go on, then.~
@1605 = ~Is that so? Well, maybe you'll find some other use for me later. Or is he better at that, too?~
@1606 = ~Is that so? Well, maybe you'll find some other use for me when you're feeling better. Go on, get yourself patched up.~
@1607 = ~So, do you want me to treat your wounds?~
@1608 = ~Cernd? He always seemed more interested in caring for animals than people.~
@1609 = ~Very well, but don't waste a spell on me. Bandaging is fine.~
@1610 = ~I'd still rather have Cernd do it.~
@1611 = ~I have a Heal spell left.~
@1612 = ~That will do. Thanks.~
@1613 = ~I don't need anything that powerful. How about a Cure Critical Wounds?~

@1615 = ~I don't need anything that powerful. How about a Cure Moderate Wounds?~
@1616 = ~I don't need anything that powerful. How about a Cure Light Wounds?~
@1617 = ~On second thought, don't waste a spell on me. Bandaging is fine.~
@1618 = ~I have a Cure Critical Wounds spell left.~
@1619 = ~I have a Cure Serious Wounds spell left.~
@1620 = ~I have a Cure Moderate Wounds spell left.~
@1621 = ~I have a Cure Light Wounds spell left.~
@1622 = ~Not a one.~
@1623 = ~Then why did you make such a big deal of this?~
@1624 = ~Then you'll just have to bandage me up.~
@1625 = ~The things I put up with...~
@1626 = ~I can still bandage your wounds.~
@1627 = ~Alright.~
@1628 = ~Just get it over with.~
@1629 = ~Forget it.~
@1630 = ~Alright, give me half a moment...~

@1636 = ~Oh? And what is the cause of this longing?~
@1637 = ~Hmm, have you been thinking about something soft and succulent, by any chance?~
@1638 = ~You aren't really talking about fruit, are you?~
@1639 = ~(You adjust your clothing and lean toward Gavin, giving him an unobstructed view of your cleavage.)~
@1640 = ~Eyes up here, Gavin.~
@1641 = ~I didn't need to know that, Gavin.~
@1642 = ~Er... forgive me. I shouldn't discuss something so crude with a respectable lady like yourself.~
@1643 = ~It's alright, Gavin. I'm not easily offended, and I don't mind a bit of naughtiness, from time to time.~
@1644 = ~Be crude, please! It's so much more fun that way!~
@1645 = ~I understand if you feel an attraction, but I'd appreciate it if you maintained a bit of decorum.~
@1646 = ~I don't want this kind of attention from you. Or any attention, come to think of it.~
@1647 = ~(gulp) Oh, gods... that doesn't help at all!~
@1648 = ~Yes, of course, but the way you moved just then...~
@1649 = ~I'll keep that in mind.~
@1650 = ~Of course!~
@1651 = ~I am sorry. I'll restrain myself from now on.~
@1652 = ~Greetings, mistress. I am called Masyrd. I understand this male is to watch?~
@1653 = ~That is correct.~
@1654 = ~He will participate when I tell him that he may.~
@1655 = ~Hmm. On second thought, you may go. I will content myself with this male.~
@1656 = ~As you command. If you would care to disrobe, we can begin with a massage.~
@1657 = ~That sounds good, but make sure the male has a good view. I want him to see you touch me.~
@1658 = ~My time is brief. Let us proceed to the coupling.~
@1659 = ~I have changed my mind. You may go, and I will content myself with this male.~
@1660 = ~As you desire, though I will be obliged to inform the overseer that you terminated my services early because you wished to enjoy one of your own males rather than because my performance was unsatisfactory.~
@1661 = ~Whatever. Just get out.~
@1662 = ~On second thought, go ahead with the massage. I might as well get what I paid for.~
@1663 = ~(The drow's touch is skilled, easing cramped muscles without inducing the lethargy such relief might otherwise produce.)~
@1664 = ~We are ready to proceed to more intimate caresses, if you desire it.~
@1665 = ~Disrobe, male. I want to witness your reaction to the sight of Masyrd pleasuring me.~
@1666 = ~Very nice, Masyrd. I am ready.~
@1667 = ~That will do, Masyrd. My male can take it from here.~
@1668 = ~As you desire, mistress. If you will but remove your clothing and lie on the bed, I would be happy to render any intimate service you may require.~
@1669 = ~At your command, mistress.~

@1671 = ~(The drow disrobes while you position yourself comfortably on the bed, then gently parts your legs, kneeling between them. He sets to work at once, teasing your most sensitive skin with soft, tentative strokes with his tongue. When he feels you begin to respond, he increases the pressure, sometimes flicking with the tip of his tongue, other times applying gentle suction with his lips. When the first moans escape you, he adds to the stimulus, probing you with his finger as well as his mouth.)~
@1672 = ~Shall we continue, mistress?~
@1673 = ~Yes, but let me get on top of you. I want my male to see you enter me.~
@1674 = ~Continue what you're doing, Masyrd. I am very close...~
@1675 = ~My male can take it from here, Masyrd.~
@1676 = ~As it pleases you, mistress.~

@1679 = ~(You crouch facing Masyrd then lower yourself onto him. Gavin can watch, but whether he's feeling rage or excitement, you don't want to see it. Besides, the stimulation is much greater for you this way.)~

@1681 = ~That will do, Masyrd. My male can finish the deed.~
@1682 = ~Please... Veldrin... will you not allow me to give you release?~
@1683 = ~Silence, male! Your place is to watch!~
@1684 = ~Masyrd will do it this time. You may attempt it the next.~
@1685 = ~Very well. Masyrd, move aside.~
@1686 = ~At last! I feared he would never leave! Please, m... my lady, may I take you? My need is great!~
@1687 = ~You may do only what you can accomplish with your mouth and with your hands. Your relief will have to wait.~
@1688 = ~Yes! Do it now!~
@1689 = ~Maybe we should both calm down. This has gone too far, and I'm feeling more than a little disgusted.~
@1690 = ~(Masyrd moans softly as you descend upon him, then thrusts his hips upward to increase your pleasure. Gavin's expression is intense, but not completely readable in your present state of distraction. His own lust is obvious, however.)~
@1691 = ~(Masyrd's hands first grip your hips and he pulls you onto himself, then one of his hands snakes around to touch you intimately. You can feel his own excitement building.)~
@1692 = ~Mistress... may I have the pleasure of release?~
@1693 = ~Yes, Masyrd, I'm ready myself. Do it!~
@1694 = ~No! Withdraw, and let the other male take your place.~
@1695 = ~Restrain yourself! You may not have your pleasure until I do!~
@1696 = ~No! I am to be pleased here, not either of you!~
@1697 = ~(Gavin needs no further invitation. He plunges himself into you at once, driving you both toward inevitable release. Your passion crests, but his is not far behind. At last, with a gasp that is almost a sob, he is done, and he begins to withdraw.)~
@1698 = ~(He obeys at once, throwing himself into the task with unfeigned enthusiasm. When you are satisfied at last, he pulls away from you and rises to sit on his haunches.)~
@1699 = ~Ah... Veldrin... I have pleased you, I trust?~
@1700 = ~You have, faithful one.~
@1701 = ~I am not displeased.~
@1702 = ~Your training is lacking, male. We will undertake it soon.~
@1703 = ~As... as you wish.~
@1704 = ~(Pleasure washes over you as Masyrd thrusts into you. Finally, he too is spent, and you feel him begin to recede.)~
@1705 = ~As... as you command.~
@1706 = ~(Masyrd obeys, though he becomes far less energetic than before. Finally, when he feels your release, he withdraws.)~
@1707 = ~Let us dress ourselves and rejoin the others.~
@1708 = ~I look forward to it... when we are alone.~
@1709 = ~Is the other male to have his turn with you now?~
@1710 = ~Yes. Obey, male.~
@1711 = ~There is no need, as I am satisfied already.~
@1712 = ~<CHARNAME>, where's Imoen?~ [bgav143]
@1713 = ~I told you already. She was captured by the Cowled Wizards.~
@1714 = ~Remember how I told you that I was imprisoned? Imoen was captured by Cowled Wizards just as we were escaping.~
@1715 = ~She's been captured by the Cowled Wizards, and I'm trying to find a way to rescue her.~
@1716 = ~She got caught practicing magic without a license. The Cowled Wizards dragged her off. I'm in no real hurry to get her back.~
@1717 = ~Who cares, as long as she's gone?~
@1718 = ~Why do you care? I parted company with her long before I met you, and good riddance to her.~
@1719 = ~I remembered the name. When I heard that she was captured with you in Baldur's Gate, I became curious. Never mind.~
@1720 = ~We have to get her back!~
@1721 = ~I know. I'm doing everything I can.~
@1722 = ~We will, but we need to prepare ourselves. We're probably her only chance of rescue, so I don't want to ruin it by getting ourselves killed in the process.~
@1723 = ~I'm not in that much of a hurry, to be honest with you. You know we were never close.~
@1724 = ~You sound very determined. I had not expected this reaction from you.~
@1725 = ~I'm enjoying the break from her chirpy babble, to tell you the truth.~
@1726 = ~Don't tell me what we have to do, cleric!~
@1727 = ~How can you say that? She's your oldest friend!~
@1728 = ~We were never really all that close.~
@1729 = ~I'm not saying I don't want her back! It's just that if we take the time to prepare properly, we stand a better chance of rescuing her.~
@1730 = ~No, Gavin, she just insisted on following me around. I don't really care if I never see her again.~
@1731 = ~You seem very interested in this, Gavin.~
@1732 = ~What?!~
@1733 = ~Oh, no! I'll help you, of course. She's my friend, too, and I can't bear thinking that she's in trouble.~
@1734 = ~Well, that's a relief! She's my friend, too, and I can't bear thinking that she's in trouble.~
@1735 = ~Good plan! I'm glad you're thinking of these things. But let's not take too long, all right?~
@1736 = ~Well, I do consider Imoen a good friend, and I can't bear to think of what she must be going through while you talk about her so dismissively. Please, if there's a way to rescue her, let's do it.~
@1737 = ~She's my friend, <CHARNAME>. I want to help her.~
@1738 = ~That's heartless. She's always been a good friend to you, and I'm rather fond of her myself... as a friend. If there's a way to help her, I want to find it.~
@1739 = ~Well, that just puts me in my place, doesn't it? But she's my friend, <CHARNAME>, and I want to help her.~
@1740 = ~Well, here we are. I brought my sketchbook, if you're still interested in that drawing.~ [bgav144]
@1741 = ~How do we do this?~
@1742 = ~Are you really going to draw me? I thought you just wanted to see me naked.~
@1743 = ~I'm a little nervous.~
@1744 = ~I don't think I can go through with this after all.~
@1745 = ~The important thing is to be comfortable. You don't do anything that makes you uneasy, and I don't ask you to. We'll start out by having you pose fully clothed so that you can get used to posing for a drawing. If you find the experience agreeable, and if you're satisfied with the drawing, I'll leave the room while you undress and get settled, and then we'll repeat the process while you're nude.~
@1746 = ~How am I supposed to relax?~
@1747 = ~Will you be leaving your clothes on?~
@1748 = ~Have you done this before?~
@1749 = ~Have you ever posed nude yourself?~
@1750 = ~You were the one that asked for a nude portrait. If I were merely pleasing myself, I would be just as happy drawing you fully clothed. Would you prefer that?~
@1751 = ~No, I still want to pose nude for you. I just wanted to make sure that you were really interested in drawing me and not just looking for a cheap thrill.~
@1752 = ~I wouldn't mind if it went beyond posing.~
@1753 = ~Let's leave the clothes on, then.~
@1754 = ~Maybe you'd better just go.~
@1755 = ~I'll be concentrating on transferring what I see to the paper. I won't be thinking impure thoughts at all, I promise.~
@1756 = ~We've seen each other naked before, <CHARNAME>. If that was what I wanted, I wouldn't have bothered bringing my sketchbook.~
@1757 = ~I would mind. When I draw, I'm concentrating on transferring what I see to the paper. I'm not thinking in a way that would lead to anything else. I'd like to keep it like that.~
@1758 = ~We'll have to save that for another time. When I draw, I'm not thinking in a way that would lead to intimacy. I'd like to keep it like that.~
@1759 = ~We'd be starting out like that in any case.~
@1760 = ~Let me explain what's involved, and if you're still interested, we can continue from there.~
@1761 = ~That's perfectly understandable. You might feel better if I explained how it works, though.~
@1762 = ~Aye, though not much in recent years. Novices are encouraged to pursue their artistic talents as well as their religious studies, so oftentimes, those of us who liked to draw would pool our funds and hire a model. One of the more senior dawnbringers would oversee the sessions and provide artistic instruction to anyone who asked.~
@1763 = ~The church of Lathander attracts a lot of artists, so there were always plenty of interested novices, priests, and members of the faithful to share the expenses and offer advice. Once Lanie was born, though, I could no longer afford the coin to spend on drawing lessons.~
@1764 = ~Fair enough. It's important that we're both completely comfortable, and if one of us isn't, then we won't do it at all. Sleep well, <CHARNAME>.~
@1765 = ~Some models like to drink some wine before they start to pose. I brought some with me just in case, but if you're uncomfortable enough to need it, I would just as soon not do it at all.~
@1766 = ~That's entirely up to you. When I was still taking drawing classes at the temple, the students remained clothed, but the classes were conducted in a formal setting. We're less formal here, and it's just the two of us. If you would feel more at ease if we were both equally exposed, I can take my clothing off, but if you prefer a physical barrier, that's alright with me, too.~
@1767 = ~You don't have to decide now. We would be starting out fully dressed, anyway.~
@1768 = ~Did you have any more questions?~
@1769 = ~Would you mind telling me how it's done?~
@1770 = ~Will you be leaving your clothes on the whole time?~
@1771 = ~I don't have any more questions. I'm ready to begin.~
@1772 = ~We'll start out fully dressed. You'll pose and I'll draw you that way. If you're comfortable with the idea of posing for a drawing and if you're satisfied with my work, then we'll repeat the procedure while you're nude. I would suggest choosing different poses for the two drawings, though. Maintaining a pose for any length of time can be tiring.~
@1773 = ~Alright, then, you should choose a pose for the first drawing. I'd suggest different poses for the two sketches to reduce your fatigue, but that's up to you.~
@1774 = ~If you'd prefer a classic pose, you can lie on your side with your head resting on your lower arm and your other arm either extended along your flank and hip or forward across your body. Or you can cross your arms over your head. Another classic is to sit facing me with your knees up and your ankles crossed, and your arms and head resting on your knees.~
@1775 = ~If you would like something a little more dramatic, you sit with your legs facing me, but with your torso turned a quarter of the way to one side, as if you're looking over your shoulder. You would fold one leg behind you in the direction you're turning, and position the other one in front of you to preserve your modesty.~
@1776 = ~If you would like something more playful, you can lie on your belly with your knees bent, supporting your torso on your crossed forearms. You can hold a book for that one, if you like, and make it look like you're reading.~
@1777 = ~The first one is clothed, remember, and you'll want a different pose for the second drawing.~
@1778 = ~I'll lie on my side.~
@1779 = ~I'll sit facing you with my ankles crossed in front of me.~
@1780 = ~I'll sit looking away from you.~
@1781 = ~I'll lie on my belly.~
@1782 = ~I think I'd rather you just left.~
@1783 = ~Aye, several times. All participants in the temple's drawing classes were encouraged to pose at least once themselves to gain a better understanding of the model's perspective, and then once Lanie came along, it was an easy way to earn a little extra coin.~
@1784 = ~Alright, then, make yourself comfortable. Each drawing will take about half an hour, but we can take breaks if you need them. If you start to feel uncomfortable at any time for any reason, just say the word and I'll leave.~
@1785 = ~It's been about ten minutes, and I'm half done now. Are you alright, or do you need a break?~
@1786 = ~I'm fine. Let's keep going.~
@1787 = ~I'd like some of that wine, I think.~
@1788 = ~I need to stretch.~
@1789 = ~I think we'd better stop.~
@1790 = ~Aaaaand we're done! Why don't you get up and walk around a bit, shake some of the stiffness out, and take a look at the first drawing.~
@1791 = ~I like it! Let's do the nude.~
@1792 = ~The drawing is alright, but I think we'd better stop here.~
@1793 = ~This is not your best work.~
@1794 = ~Are you nervous or thirsty?~
@1795 = ~I'm just a bit thirsty.~
@1796 = ~I'm a little nervous about what's to come, but I still want to do it.~
@1797 = ~I don't think I can go on. We'd better stop.~
@1798 = ~Good idea. Just remember your pose and go back to it when you're ready.~
@1799 = ~I'm glad you like it.~
@1800 = ~Now, how do you want to do the next part? Should I leave my clothes on or take them off?~
@1801 = ~You can leave them on.~
@1802 = ~I'm surprised you aren't more self-conscious about this.~
@1803 = ~If I'm getting naked, you are too.~
@1804 = ~If that's what you prefer, I'll just gather up my things and let you get some rest. Sleep well, <CHARNAME>.~
@1805 = ~Mabye not. I won't ask you to sit for the second drawing then. Sleep well, <CHARNAME>.~
@1806 = ~Fair enough. The wine is in the pitcher beside you. We'll take a break and pick it back up in a few moments.~
@1807 = ~Alright, just take it easy. The wine is in the pitcher beside you, but we don't have to do anything you don't want to do.~
@1808 = ~Alright, which pose would you prefer for your second drawing?~
@1809 = ~Why should I be? There's nothing evil about our bodies... quite the opposite, really. We wear clothing to provide warmth, protection, and a barrier between ourselves and those we don't trust with greater intimacy, but this room is warm enough, we aren't likely to need protection from briars or brambles, and I trust you with more than my modesty, so clothes are irrelevant.~
@1810 = ~If you feel that way about it, I'll expect you to disrobe every time we're alone together.~
@1811 = ~Alright, so strip down. If I'm going to be naked, you are, too.~
@1812 = ~You're a strange man, Gavin.~
@1813 = ~You're unnerving me. You should go.~
@1814 = ~(He unceremoniously removes his clothing and sits back down at the table, fixing his attention on the sketchbook in his lap while you disrobe and settle yourself in your next pose.)~
@1815 = ~Alright, I'll step outside for a moment. Call me back in when you're ready.~
@1816 = ~I don't know if I'd go that far, <CHARNAME>. Right now, we're working on a drawing, but if there's nothing else to distract us... well, no sense letting things get out of hand.~
@1817 = ~You aren't the first person to say that.~
@1818 = ~(Once you alert Gavin that you are ready, he gets settled himself and begins to draw.)~
@1819 = ~So what's your pleasure? Do my clothes stay on or would you rather I removed them?~
@1820 = ~Strip.~
@1821 = ~Alright, we've been at it for about five minutes, and I've got the basic outlines blocked out. How are you holding up?~
@1822 = ~I'm fine. Carry on.~
@1823 = ~(You look for signs that he might be enjoying this more than he lets on.)~
@1824 = ~I'm not sure I can do this.~
@1825 = ~(He bends over his sketchbook again and starts filling in the details.)~
@1826 = ~(He appears perfectly calm and completely relaxed.)~
@1827 = ~I'm alright. We can continue.~
@1828 = ~Are you getting anything out of this?~
@1829 = ~I've got a beautiful model and I'm doing something I enjoy...~
@1830 = ~Very nice, <CHARNAME>, you chose an excellent pose. The light and shadow is working out very well. I'm about half done. Are you still alright?~
@1831 = ~Yes. I'm looking forward to seeing it when it's done.~
@1832 = ~(You take the opportunity provided by Gavin's distraction to study *his* form.)~
@1833 = ~(You look to see if your nudity is having any effect on Gavin.)~
@1834 = ~I'm starting to feel a little uncomfortable.~
@1835 = ~<CHARNAME>, be honest with me. Were you hoping this would lead to something more than a pair of drawings?~
@1836 = ~In all honesty, yes, I was.~
@1837 = ~I wasn't going to rule it out, but I'm not going to insist.~
@1838 = ~No, all I wanted was the drawings.~
@1839 = ~I think you'll be pleased. You really are an amazing subject. The lighting in here is perfect... I love what it's doing with your skin. I only wish I had some colored pigments to capture the glow, but even in charcoal, it's turning out quite well.~
@1840 = ~Are we almost done?~
@1841 = ~I'm enjoying this myself. Take your time.~
@1842 = ~(Gavin seems as little concerned about his own nudity as he is about yours. He sketches industriously, sometimes bending this way or that to see areas that his sketchbook might be blocking. He sits with his knees together, but you can see that his legs are long, even for someone as tall as he is, and well-muscled, as are his chest and shoulders. His sketchboook blocks your view of his abdomen.)~
@1843 = ~(Apart from his raptures about the play of light and shadow across your skin, he does not even appear to notice.)~
@1844 = ~Then we'd better put an end to this session right now. You're beautiful, <CHARNAME>, and I've enjoyed the opportunity to draw you, but if I start thinking of you in that way...~
@1845 = ~Oh no...  I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>. I need to leave NOW. Sleep well.~
@1846 = ~Good, because objectivity is very important.~
@1847 = ~Good, good...~
@1848 = ~We're done. And I must say that I'm very pleased with the way this turned out. It might be the best piece I've done. Here are your drawings, <CHARNAME>. I'll just collect my things and let you get some rest. Sleep well.~
@1849 = ~We're almost done here anyway.~
@1850 = ~Are you still interested in doing that drawing? I brought paper and charcoal.~ [bgav145]
@1851 = ~How do you want to do this?~
@1852 = ~Are you sure you're comfortable with this?~
@1853 = ~Have you ever posed nude before?~
@1854 = ~I've changed my mind. Maybe this isn't such a good idea, after all.~
@1855 = ~It's pretty straightforward. I take my clothing off, you tell me how you want me to pose, I stay still while you draw, then I get dressed and go to my own room.~
@1856 = ~You sound like you've done this before.~
@1857 = ~Are you sure you're comfortable doing this?~
@1858 = ~You don't have to go back to your room if you don't want to.~
@1859 = ~Shall we begin?~
@1860 = ~I'll probably have to keep my eyes closed the whole time, but I'll be fine.~
@1861 = ~You'll be naked. Won't that make you uncomfortable?~
@1862 = ~Why would you close your eyes?~
@1863 = ~How do we go about it?~
@1864 = ~Maybe this isn't such a good idea, after all.~
@1865 = ~The church of Lathander attracts a lot of artists, and many dawnbringers are artists themselves. They had regular lessons at the Song of the Morning, including life drawing. Students, including novices who were old enough to participate, were encouraged to model themselves to allow them to experience what it was like on the other side of the sketchbook. That, and after Lanie was born, it was an easy way to earn some extra coin. So yes, I've done this before.~
@1866 = ~We won't do anything unless you're completely comfortable about it. Since you have reservations, it's best if I go back to my room now, rather than risk offending you. Sleep well, <CHARNAME>.~
@1867 = ~You said you wanted me to pose for you, so I'm here with that in mind. If you had other ideas, then I'd better leave, because I need detachment if I'm going to do this without embarrassing us both.~
@1868 = ~No, don't go. We'll stick to drawing.~
@1869 = ~But think about the possibilities! We're alone, you'll already be naked...~
@1870 = ~I won't be thinking about anything that would make me uncomfortable. Don't worry. I'm perfectly capable of behaving myself.~
@1871 = ~You don't have to, you know.~
@1872 = ~It helps me relax... and it allows me to pretend that no one is looking at me. My brain knows the difference between artistic observation and other kinds of attention, but there are times when reason can be overruled.~
@1873 = ~You could just let nature take its course.~
@1874 = ~Please don't be offended, <CHARNAME>, but if you're going into this with that idea already fixed in your mind, I'm going to have to leave. I came here tonight expecting to help with your artistic aspirations, and I'm just not prepared for anything else. Sleep well.~
@1875 = ~(He turns around and disrobes, then picks up a towel and tucks it loosely around his waist.)~
@1876 = ~How do you want me to pose?~
@1877 = ~What do you suggest?~
@1878 = ~Lie on the bed and raise yourself up on one elbow.~
@1879 = ~Sit on the floor and draw your knees up against your chest.~
@1880 = ~Turn sideways and pose like you're throwing a rock.~
@1881 = ~Kneel facing me and lean back, like you're about to take a spear through the chest.~
@1882 = ~Straddle that chair.~
@1883 = ~Lounge sideways in the armchair with your back up against one of the arms and your legs over the other.~
@1884 = ~This is likely to take a while, so I'd rather not have to hold a taxing pose. I could stand like I'm playing tug-of-war.~
@1885 = ~Like this?~
@1886 = ~Perfect.~
@1887 = ~Roll onto your back a bit more, and raise both arms up over your head.~
@1888 = ~Bring your knee forward a bit more. There's no need for quite that much exposure.~
@1889 = ~Bring your knee up and put your foot flat on the bed. The shadows on the inside of your thigh look good in this light.~
@1890 = ~Drape the towel back over your hips. Folds of fabric are easier to draw.~
@1891 = ~Let your head fall back a bit, like you're exhausted.~
@1892 = ~Alright, then, I'm just going to close my eyes and hold this pose. Let me know when you're done.~
@1893 = ~(You start sketching immediately.)~
@1894 = ~(You take a few moments to enjoy the view.)~
@1895 = ~(You get up very quietly and creep over to the bed.)~
@1896 = ~I can't do this.~
@1897 = ~Better?~
@1898 = ~Tasteful is always better.~
@1899 = ~I can do that.~
@1900 = ~Whatever is easier for you.~
@1901 = ~That puts a bit of strain on the neck, but I'll be alright for a while.~
@1902 = ~(You work in comfortable silence, and your drawing is done a short time later.)~
@1903 = ~Thank you, Gavin. You can get dressed now.~
@1904 = ~(Now that the drawing is done, you pause to contemplate your subject.)~
@1905 = ~(After a few moments of silence, Gavin opens his eyes again.)~
@1906 = ~Is everything alright? I didn't hear the charcoal on the paper.~
@1907 = ~You've got good hearing if you could hear that.~
@1908 = ~I was just getting focused.~
@1909 = ~I was enjoying the view.~
@1910 = ~It's a familiar sound. Do you want to do this or not?~
@1911 = ~I'm ready to draw now.~
@1912 = ~Focus is important, aye.~
@1913 = ~I was also enjoying the view.~
@1914 = ~When the drawing is done, you'll be able to 'enjoy the view' all you like, and I won't even have to know about it. Do you want to do this or not?~
@1915 = ~Alright, let's get to it, then.~
@1916 = ~<CHARNAME>, what are you doing?~
@1917 = ~I didn't know you could hear me!~
@1918 = ~The light was bad. I was getting up to move the lamp.~
@1919 = ~I just wanted to reposition you a little.~
@1920 = ~The drawing is done.~
@1921 = ~You're standing right next to my head. I can hear you breathe from this distance. Do you want to do this or not?~
@1922 = ~Aye, we need good light.~
@1923 = ~If you need me to move, you should tell me. Do you need me to move?~
@1924 = ~No, you're alright the way you are.~
@1925 = ~(He sits on the floor and hugs his knees, resting his head on top of them. He crosses his ankles in front of himself for modesty.)~
@1926 = ~That looks like a feminine pose. You should uncross your ankles.~
@1927 = ~Don't hug your knees so much. Spread them a bit more and fold your arms across the top.~
@1928 = ~Raise you head. I want to see your face.~
@1929 = ~Can you look to the side a bit more?~
@1930 = ~(You get up very quietly and creep over to him.)~
@1931 = ~Well, that will certainly prove I'm no woman.~
@1932 = ~That's a good manly pose for you. I'll try not to laugh. How's this?~
@1933 = ~Turn your body to face me a little more.~
@1934 = ~Bring your throwing arm back more. I want the upper part of your torso facing front.~
@1935 = ~Can you move your right leg a little further back. You look like you're going to fall over.~
@1936 = ~Raise your left arm up a bit. You're throwing that rock high, so you'll need your left arm to balance the right.~
@1937 = ~Can you look angry?~
@1938 = ~Putting it all on display, but alright.~
@1939 = ~If I move it any further back, I might fall over for real, but I'll see what I can do.~
@1940 = ~Maybe I'd better bring my left knee up a bit as well. If I were really throwing something, I wouldn't be able to do it flat-footed.~
@1941 = ~I can try.~
@1942 = ~You're standing right next to me. I can hear you breathe from this distance. Do you want to do this or not?~
@1943 = ~That's going to be a tough pose to hold for any length of time, but I'll give it a shot. How's this.~
@1944 = ~Rest your hands on your ankles. It will take some of the strain off your thighs.~
@1945 = ~I need you to let your head fall back.~
@1946 = ~Can you arch your back more?~
@1947 = ~Move your knees further apart.~
@1948 = ~Bring your ankles a little closer together. That will rotate your thighs outward and give you better muscle definition.~
@1949 = ~Thanks for thinking of that.~
@1950 = ~That feels a bit better, actually.~
@1951 = ~I guess.~
@1952 = ~It puts a bit of strain on the hips, but I'll survive.~
@1953 = ~If that's what you want...~
@1954 = ~Can you slide forward a little more? I'd like your back a little straighter.~
@1955 = ~Spread your knees a bit. It looks like you're gripping that chair for dear life.~
@1956 = ~Take your hands out of your lap and fold your arms across the top of the chair. You can rest your chin on your wrists.~
@1957 = ~Move your feet further in front of you. It gives your calf muscles better definition.~
@1958 = ~Can you keep your eyes open for this pose? I'd like you to look like we're having a conversation.~
@1959 = ~Er... alright...~
@1960 = ~I've already got one knee pointing north and the other pointing south. How much of a groin shot do you want?~
@1961 = ~It will also give me cramps if I hold this for too long, but I should be alright for a while.~
@1962 = ~How about I leave them closed until the very end? With everything front and center like this, it's going to be difficult for me to remain relaxed otherwise.~
@1963 = ~Heh. All I need is a goblet in my hand and someone peeling me grapes.~
@1964 = ~Put your left arm up over the back of the chair, like you really are holding a goblet.~
@1965 = ~Let's show off those long legs of yours a bit more. Take your right leg off of the arm of the chair and stretch it out in front of you.~
@1966 = ~Bring your right arm up and hook your hand around the back of your neck. I want to open up your torso a bit more.~
@1967 = ~Can you turn the top of your body toward me a bit more? I want it to look like we're having a conversation.~
@1968 = ~Can you look a little more sensuous? Think about those peeled grapes.~
@1969 = ~There's a goblet right here. I'll hold one for real.~
@1970 = ~You'd better turn the paper sideways, then. You'll run out of room.~
@1971 = ~Heh. Armpits it is.~
@1972 = ~How's that?~
@1973 = ~I'd really better not do that.~
@1974 = ~How did it go?~
@1975 = ~I'm pleased. Want to see?~
@1976 = ~I'm surprised you were able to hold it together that long.~
@1977 = ~I'm a little disappointed.  You didn't react at all.~
@1978 = ~The drawing could be better.~
@1979 = ~(Gavin remains posed exactly as you left him, though he is beginning to look a bit bored.)~
@1980 = ~We're done. You can get dressed now.~
@1981 = ~(You stealthily approach Gavin and begin to stroke him.)~
@1982 = ~We're all done. Was there anything else you wanted to do while you've got your clothes off?~
@1983 = ~(You pick up the water goblet beside you, dip your fingertips into it, and flick some water at Gavin.)~
@1984 = ~Hey! What was that for?~
@1985 = ~We're done.~
@1986 = ~You looked hot.~
@1987 = ~I wanted to see if anything could bring you back to the present place and time.~
@1988 = ~You were sleeping.~
@1989 = ~Of course I want to see! Let me get dressed and I'll take a look at it.~
@1990 = ~I've had a lot of practice. I've spent most of my adult life trying not to think about anything that might get me excited. Let me put my clothes on and I'll take a look at your drawing.~
@1991 = ~It wasn't as easy as it looked. Let me get dressed and I'll take a look at your drawing.~
@1992 = ~I'll be the judge of that. Let me just get my clothes back on.~
@1993 = ~<CHARNAME>! Stop that! Are you done already?~
@1994 = ~Yes. Now let's see if we can think of anything else to do while your clothes are off.~
@1995 = ~I was trying to find out if anything would get through to you. You were like a statue the whole time.~
@1996 = ~I suppose. Want to see the drawing?~
@1997 = ~I'm here to pose, nothing more. I'm sorry if I led you to believe that I wanted more from this than that. Let me get dressed and I'll see what you've done.~
@1998 = ~You could have just said. Let me get dressed and I'll take a look.~
@1999 = ~What? It's quite cool in here. If you're done, I'll put my clothes back on and have a look at what you've done.~
@2000 = ~I was meditating. If you're done playing pranks, I'll just get dressed and have a look at your drawing.~
@2001 = ~You have talent, I can see that, but it's possible that you might have... ah... exaggerated a bit.~
@2002 = ~I draw what I see.~
@2003 = ~We never see ourselves like others see us.~
@2004 = ~I thought you might prefer a more flattering portrayal.~
@2005 = ~You need all the help you can get.~
@2006 = ~If you say so...~
@2007 = ~That's true.~
@2008 = ~I always got the most enjoyment from art that portrayed what the artist saw. It doesn't have to be real, because we all filter our perceptions through our own beliefs, but it does have to be true. I know what I am, and after this session, so do you. You don't have to flatter me.~
@2009 = ~How charming. Still, I should probably be pleased that you aren't going out of your way to bolster my pride.~
@2010 = ~Well, I'm a bit fatigued, so I think I'll go back to my room and get some rest. Sleep well.~
