@65   = ~It was getting on in the year, and I was still a good day out from Nashkel. We'd had a frost, and I was feeling a bit ill, since I had been going too often without enough sleep or food, so I decided to supplement my trail rations with what greens I could find. The frost had withered the leaves a bit, and I thought I was eating goat thistle.~

@68   = ~I still had my pack, and what little gold I had, so that was something, but I reckon I must have lost at least one day, possibly two.

@108  = ~Larger fortunes have been won in the City of Coin. We'll find a way to raise the money.~
@109  = ~You're right about that, but the stakes are a woman's life. I pray that Lathander will forgive the sin of allowing undead to un-live, but it would be well to make sure Imoen is safe before rectifying that.~

@120  = ~I doubt it.~
@121  = ~What is that supposed to mean?~
@122  = ~Nothing, Gavin, nothing at all.~
@123  = ~Er... there's a certain agelessness about her. She must have a very good diet.~

@133  = ~I was a bit annoyed when weeks turned into months, but there's amusement enough to be found in Baldur's Gate. No harm done.~
@134  = ~You had a good excuse. Even if I was angry with you for not returning when you said you would, I forgave you the moment you told me what kept you.~
@135  = ~I didn't even notice.~
@136  = ~I'm angry, yes, but it will pass.~
@137  = ~You're on your last chance, Gavin. Just so you know.~
@138  = ~That's a relief.~

@148  = ~Much has changed, since then. I've learned some things in the time we were apart.~
@149  = ~Enough to make you forgive me for having Bhaal for a father?~
@150  = ~Maybe you've just noticed the lack of competition you've got now.~
@151  = ~You say that now, but I'm betting that in no time flat, you'll be bitching at me now just as much as you did then. You didn't think much of the way I did things.~

@153  = ~Why are you talking like we were best friends? We barely knew each other.~

@155  = ~Just don't get any ideas. I didn't want you then, and I don't want you now.~
@156  = ~I panicked. I knew even then that you had no control over your ancestry, but it still frightened me past all reason. I'm sorry.~
@157  = ~I was too jealous and I had no right to be. I see that now, even if I didn't see it then.~
@158  = ~Maybe I was more severe with you than I needed to be.~
@159  = ~And how do you feel about attention now?~
@160  = ~Why don't you wait and see for yourself.~
@161  = ~Attention is all right.~
@162  = ~I'm not sure.~
@163  = ~Try anything and I'll tear your arm off.~

@165  = ~Ahem. I shall keep that in mind.~
@166  = ~Let's just see how it goes.~
@167  = ~Ahem. Yes, well, we wouldn't want that, would we?~
@168  = ~Understood.~
@169  = ~Ah. Well, Perhaps we'll get to know each other better in the future.~
@170  = ~Yes.~
@171  = ~Apology accepted.~
@172  = ~Too little, too late.~
@173  = ~What, no groveling?~
@174  = ~Thank you.~
@175  = ~Heh. I'm not very good at groveling. I hope you'll settle for a sincere apology.~
@176  = ~It was bound to happen sooner or later.~
@177  = ~Ah. Thank you for letting me know.~
@178  = ~I'm sorry.~
@179  = ~What? You mean you aren't as fixated on my flaws as you were then?~
@180  = ~I'm still a heartless bitch, you know.~
@181  = ~I deserve your scorn. I was too shallow, by far.~
@182  = ~I was too hard on you. I'm not ashamed to admit I was wrong. I'm sorry.~
@183  = ~Whatever else, your anger is justified.~
@184  = ~It's kind of you to say that, but I know that I was wrong.~
@185  = ~Yes, I suppose we do, at that.~
@186  = ~Yes, I suppose we must. Odd, how the prospect of another day can bring so little joy.~
@187  = ~That's a given, but what about *us*? I never intended to be gone so long, but I was, and I fear much may have changed since then.~
@188  = ~Nothing has changed, Gavin. I love you just as much as ever.~
@189  = ~I was angry, I admit, but I've long since forgiven you. I'm just happy you're here now.~
@190  = ~I still care about you, Gavin, but I think we may have rushed things a little too much.~
@191  = ~I saw so little of the world when I made you that promise. Now that I've seen more, I'd like a chance to experience some of the things I might have missed.~
@192  = ~There's no use in trying to phrase this delicately, so I'm not even going to try. I like making love to you, and I don't want that to end, but I just don't want the commitment. I want to experience life, and all it has to offer.~
@193  = ~I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but I've given my heart to another. I still value your company, but I've given my affection elsewhere.~
@194  = ~I can't believe you're even talking about an 'us' after everything you put me through. It's over, Gavin. Please don't make this harder than it already is.~
@195  = ~Stop fretting over the past and come to bed.~
@196  = ~I can't tell you how happy I am that you're so forgiving. Gods know I deserve a lashing or worse, for all I put you through, but here you are, just as wonderful as always.~
@197  = ~I... I see. I suppose on some level I knew that I might return to find that your feelings toward me had changed, but I had hoped that you would be able to forgive me.~
@198  = ~It has nothing to do with you, Gavin. I've never been angry with you, but can you blame me if I want to see what else is out there?~
@199  = ~It irritates me no end that you're forever putting Lanie's needs and wellbeing ahead of mine. If you hadn't been chasing her all over Faerun, we wouldn't be having this conversation now.~
@200  = ~I admit, I am a bit annoyed that you took so long getting to me, but that isn't the reason I want more freedom now. I have choices now that I didn't have then and I want to see where they lead.~
@201  = ~That is so like you, always imagining that you can charm your way out of any trouble you find yourself in. Not this time.~
@202  = ~I *do* forgive you. I understand completely why you were gone so long. It's just that, like it or not, feelings change.~
@203  = ~So... what now?~
@204  = ~Let's take a step back. I'd like our relationship to be like it was before we became engaged.~
@205  = ~I admit, I enjoy making love to you, so I don't want that to change, but I want the freedom to explore possibilities with others.~
@206  = ~We end it. I'm sorry, Gavin, I know this isn't what you want to hear, but it's the only way.~
@207  = ~You take your miserable, excuse-making ass somewhere I don't have to look at it for a while. After that, I don't even want you looking in my direction.~
@208  = ~Oh, who am I fooling? I could never leave you, even if I wanted to. Let's pretend this conversation never happened.~
@209  = ~You mean I have to try to win you all over again?~
@210  = ~You did it once.~
@211  = ~I wouldn't have put it like that, but yes, you do.~
@212  = ~If it makes you feel any better, I already like you.~
@213  = ~Ew, no. I'm not some doll at a carnival you can win by putting three darts in a bullseye.~
@214  = ~Come on, Gavin, it will be fun! You know the best part of any romance is the courtship.~
@215  = ~(sigh) I guess it could have been worse.~
@216  = ~(sigh) Wonderful. Still, it could have been worse... I guess.~
@217  = ~What? No! I never thought you were!~
@218  = ~Listen, <CHARNAME>, I'm tired. I'm saying stupid things, and when I try to fix it, I'm just making it worse.~
@219  = ~You want to go back to the way things were before we got engaged, I can do that, but I'd better stop talking now before I get myself in any more trouble.~
@220  = ~Oh, that's just wonderful. I remember the stammer and the quivering gut I had the first time around. This time should be so much better, now that I know I've already failed once.~
@221  = ~I'm sorry. I know I should be overjoyed you aren't just throwing me out on my ear. We can go back to the way things were before we got engaged.~
@222  = ~Meaning you want to sleep with me and with any other man who catches your fancy.~
@223  = ~I wasn't going to be that blunt, but yes, that's what I want.~
@224  = ~Maybe not just men, Gavin.~
@225  = ~I never said I wanted to lie with other men, Gavin. I just said I wanted the freedom to explore other possibilities.~
@226  = ~Is that so horrible?~
@227  = ~It's going to mean some changes, you know. If you do this, there is no going back. I'd never be able to trust you again.~
@228  = ~I'd always be on my guard, with you. If you drive me away, or even send me from your side, that would be it. Even if I decided to travel with you again later, I'd certainly never agree to lie with you again.~
@229  = ~Is this what you want?~
@230  = ~Yes, Gavin, it is.~
@231  = ~That's a little unreasonable, don't you think?~
@232  = ~Freedom is worth a few sacrifices. I accept your terms.~
@233  = ~Now that I think about it more, maybe it would mean giving up too much. I like the security of our relationship, and I wouldn't want that to change.~
@234  = ~No, that isn't what I want at all. Maybe we could just go back to the way we were before we became engaged.~
@235  = ~On second thought, maybe it would be better if we just ended this. Better to part on good terms than poison our friendship.~
@236  = ~What in the nine hells is wrong with you? You come back from gods know where and then make demands of me? To hells with this relationship, and to hells with you!~
@237  = ~No, I don't think it's unreasonable at all. What you're asking goes against my very nature. If I'm going to agree to it, there are going to be some changes.~
@238  = ~Oh, all right, I agree. If I get rid of you for any reason, I won't expect you to let me back into your life.~
@239  = ~Maybe we could just go back to the way we were before we became engaged.~
@240  = ~All right, I'm done. To hells with this relationship, and to hells with you!~
@241  = ~Not what I wanted to hear, but you're right. It is better than destroying our friendship.~
@242  = ~Fine! Good night.~
@243  = ~That's a relief. For a moment, there, I thought I'd lost you.~
@244  = ~Gender isn't the issue.~
@245  = ~You can't say something like that and exect me to believe you'll stop at a hug or a meaningful glance.~
@246  = ~It goes against everything I believe a loving relationship ought to be.~
@247  = ~Not what I wanted to hear, but I guess I couldn't really have expected you to forgive... not after all that time.~
@248  = ~I expected you to be angry, but this...~
@249  = ~Are you really that selfish, <CHARNAME>? If you think I could ever abandon my child for any reason, maybe you aren't the woman I thought you were.~
@250  = ~Good night.~
@251  = ~'All it has to offer'?~
@252  = ~I... I see. Well, that certainly is not something I expected to hear. Congratulations, I guess.~
@253  = ~I see. I was afraid you would feel that way, but I had to try.~
@254  = ~With you?~
@255  = ~Who else did you have in mind?~
@256  = ~Yes, with you!~
@257  = ~There's never been anyone else.~
@258  = ~I know, we've never done this before, but I think it's time we spent the night together as lovers.~
@259  = ~I don't know, Gavin. I'm not sure I'm ready.~
@260  = ~We're waiting until we're married, remember?~
@261  = ~No one but you, now and always.~
@262  = ~(Gavin folds you in his arms and eases you onto the bedroll. Tender kisses become more urgent, and the night sounds fade away.)~
@263  = ~Yes, love, I think it is.~
@264  = ~Then we'll wait until you are. It's more than enough to have you here beside me again.~
@265  = ~Good night, love. I'll see you in the morning.~
@266  = ~I remember, and I can wait. It's more than enough to be by your side once more.~
@267  = ~Well, love, the time has come for bed, and only one question remains.~
@268  = ~Where do I sleep?~
@269  = ~With me, silly!~
@270  = ~We sleep together. There's never been anyone else.~
@271  = ~Well, I know, we've never done this before, but I think it's time we spent the night together as lovers.~
@272  = ~I don't know, Gavin. I'm not sure I'm ready to sleep with you.~
@273  = ~You've always slept alone. We're waiting until we're married, remember?~
@274  = ~Aye, one day at a time, but we've both been through much since the last time we... traveled together. It changes a person.~
@275  = ~That it does, and it's odd how you sometimes only appreciate what you've lost after it's gone.~
@276  = ~If you're trying to tell me that you want to be with me again, you can forget it.~
@277  = ~I'm looking at some things in a whole new light, that's for sure.~
@278  = ~I know. Sometimes, I miss what we used to share.~
@279  = ~Some things never change. I don't regret any of the decisions I made.~
@280  = ~I've learned to appreciate my freedom more.~
@281  = ~I haven't changed a bit.~
@282  = ~I've been thinking along those lines, too. Do you think that we might want to give things another try? Together, that is?~
@283  = ~Are you going to propose to me again?~
@284  = ~Can we really do that? Go back to the way things were between us?~
@285  = ~I don't want to rush it. I've only recently started thinking of you as anything other than a nuisance. Can we take it slow?~
@286  = ~We haven't been together in quite a while, Gavin. I'd rather not get too close too fast and wind up smothering each other.~
@287  = ~I'm sorry, Gavin. It's true that I've learned to appreciate affection more, but it's because there's someone else.~
@288  = ~I can't, Gavin. I don't want to hurt you again.~
@289  = ~Oh, any love we may have shared is long since over, but I do miss the passion. I would definitely bed you again.~
@290  = ~Someday, I hope, but it's going to take time to heal the old wounds.~
@291  = ~I feel the same way.~
@292  = ~I see.~
@293  = ~(chokes) Did I just hear what I thought I heard?~
@294  = ~Are you actually saying that you would consider renewing our engagement just so I would lie with you again?~
@295  = ~Get over yourself, Gavin. There are plenty of men who can do what you did, only better. I just don't have any at hand right now.~
@296  = ~I'm considering it, yes.~
@297  = ~No, Gavin. It's over, and I know it.~
@298  = ~Not really. I value my independence too much for that. If only it were possible to have you *and* see what else life has to offer.~
@299  = ~No, there are other reasons, too. But making love to you was always special.~
@300  = ~I wouldn't let you near me with someone else's pike.~
@301  = ~I miss the passion, Gavin. I don't want to be tied down now any more than I did then, but yes, I would like to lie with you again.~
@302  = ~That's heartless, <CHARNAME>. Whatever else might have happened, you certainly are not the woman I remember.~
@303  = ~I don't know if it's wise to rush back into a commitment right away, but maybe...~
@304  = ~By that, you mean that you want to be able to sleep with me or any other man you choose?~
@305  = ~It's going to mean some changes, you know. If you do this, there is no going back. We aren't together now, but there was always the understanding that if we wanted to, we could renew our love. That chance would die. I'd never be able to trust you again.~
@306  = ~Now that I think about it more, maybe we could recover what we lost... all of it, even the love we shared.~
@307  = ~So be it.~
@308  = ~I'm sorry. I know I should be overjoyed that you're taking me back at all. We can go back to the way things were before we got engaged.~
@309  = ~Maybe if we take things slow, get used to the idea of being around each other again, it will work out better this time.~
@310  = ~I think it will. I hope it will. Let's sleep on it, and see what tomorrow brings.~
@311  = ~You were always free. I never tried to hold you back.~
@312  = ~I've learned that I can live without any man. I like it like that.~
@313  = ~You got jealous any time I even looked at another man. I could never live like that.~
@314  = ~Gavin, I loved the passion we shared. I miss it acutely, and want it back. I'm just having a hard time accepting the commitment that goes along with it.~
@315  = ~Maybe it is time to give it another try. All right, you win.~
@316  = ~You really are too good to be true! I'm months late, and not only do you forgive me, but you're ready to cover me with affection.~
@317  = ~I am the luckiest man alive!~
@318  = ~How could I ever be angry with you, love?~
@319  = ~I was angry, true, but I forgave you the moment I found out why you were so late.~
@320  = ~(joking) I'll make you pay later.~
@321  = ~Who said I've forgiven you?~
@322  = ~I wasn't going to admit it, but I wanted one more night of lovemaking to help me decide whether or not to end it.~
@323  = ~Oh, sweet, beloved <CHARNAME>, how I've longed to hold you again!~
@324  = ~Easy, Gavin! I never said I wanted to break it off immediately. Let's just sleep on it, all right?~
@325  = ~Your absence strained my affection for you, yes, but I've also become aware of possibilities that I didn't even know existed before.~
@326  = ~I'm sorry Gavin, but you were gone for a very long time, and I did lose faith. I lost faith in you and I lost faith in us.~
@327  = ~Alright...~
@328  = ~So where do I sleep?~
@329  = ~With me.~
@330  = ~Maybe it would be better if we spent the night apart, after all.~
@331  = ~Goodnight, love. Lathander bless this new beginning, it needs all the help it can get.~
@332  = ~Did you ever find out why you were abducted?~ [bgav105]
@333  = ~I can only assume it's because I'm the child of Bhaal.~
@334  = ~Maybe he just didn't like the look of me.~
@335  = ~No, and I'm not sure I want to know.~
@336  = ~He said I had potential.~
@337  = ~Why do you think?~
@338  = ~I found out, all right. He was trying to break me and rob me of my soul.~
@339  = ~Not to my satisfaction, no, but I'm on his trail. All that remains is to follow it.~
@340  = ~That isn't important. What is important is that I find him and take back what is mine.~
@341  = ~You're probably right. Do you think Irenicus will come after you again, now that you've escaped?~
@342  = ~Anything is possible, I suppose.  I hadn't wanted to think about that.~
@343  = ~The Cowled Wizards took him away as well... though now that I think about it, he went willingly, which was kind of odd.~
@344  = ~You'll protect me if he does, won't you?~
@345  = ~If he does, I'm sure I can take him.~
@346  = ~He captured me last time because I was unprepared. If he comes again, I'll be ready.~
@347  = ~I'm certain of it.~
@348  = ~Gavin, have some mercy. I'm lucky I escaped with my life. I don't want to talk about it any more.~
@349  = ~You are?! I mean... I'm sorry. That did sound a bit panicked. I don't know what I was expecting you to say, but it wasn't that.~
@350  = ~My brother Sarevok got the glowing eyes. I just got a long line of people who want to kill me.~
@351  = ~I suppose this is going to provoke a long discussion about what I am doing to overcome the evil in my blood.~
@352  = ~It isn't something I tell many people.~
@353  = ~Does this change anything?~
@354  = ~It's true, Gavin, you're in the presence of a demigod. Aren't you awed?~
@355  = ~You sound so unconcerned about it. In your place, I'd be in fear for my life.~
@356  = ~I haven't wanted to think about it.~
@357  = ~The Cowled Wizards took the mage who did it... though he went willingly, which was kind of odd.~
@358  = ~Why should I worry when I have you to protect me?~
@359  = ~I'm not worried because I know I can take care of myself.~
@360  = ~I was taken captive last time because I was unprepared. Now, I'm ready.~
@361  = ~You do, I'm sure, but the question is, what kind of potential?~
@362  = ~I have talents of all kinds, Gavin. Maybe we can try some of them out later.~
@363  = ~I have talents of all kinds, Gavin. I'm sure you remember what some of them are.~
@364  = ~I have talents of all kinds, Gavin. Maybe someday I'll show you some of my more special ones.~
@365  = ~I have many talents. For all I know, he's talking about my prowess in bed.~
@366  = ~I'm the child of Bhaal, Gavin. That probably has something to do with it.~
@367  = ~I don't know, and I'm not sure I want to find out.~
@368  = ~I only wish I knew. The things I could do with that kind of power!~
@369  = ~Of course you don't. Sorry I reminded you.~
@370  = ~I don't know what to think.~
@371  = ~Well, that comes as no surprise.~
@372  = ~That makes two of us. I don't know, and I'm not sure I want to find out.~
@373  = ~It probably has something to do with my ancestry. I'm the child of Bhaal.~
@374  = ~I don't know. Maybe he just decided that he liked my company.~
@375  = ~I imagine not, but that isn't going to make your troubles go away.~
@376  = ~I'll manage. I always do.~
@377  = ~It's probably too much to hope that my problems will go away on their own.~
@378  = ~I've always been spontaneous. I'll think of something.~
@379  = ~You sound like Gorion, my old mentor, warming up for another lecture.~
@380  = ~So what do you advise?~
@381  = ~No, love, after everything you've been through, I imagine this is the last thing you want to think about, but avoiding it isn't going to make your problems go away.~
@382  = ~That is odd. What do you make of it?~
@383  = ~Maybe he thought it would be easier to escape when less people were watching him. It did happen right in the middle of Waukeen's Promenade.~
@384  = ~He must have known he was beaten. He was casting spell after spell. He may have run out.~
@385  = ~I try not to think too hard about things like that.~
@386  = ~It's worrying, but I don't know what to make of it.~
@387  = ~Good. That's probably the best you can do, under the circumstances.~
@388  = ~Heh. Glowing eyes wouldn't be so bad, compared to having people that want to kill you. But that brings us back to our original question. What do you plan to do about it?~
@389  = ~I am concerned, I admit, but at the moment, I was thinking more of our current problem. What are you going to do if the mage who captured you comes looking for you?~
@390  = ~I'll protect you any way I can, but I'm only human. The world is full of things that are more powerful than I am... even with the blessings the Morninglord bestowed on me.~
@391  = ~Ah, there is something else I'm good for, it seems.~
@392  = ~I know you're competent, and powerful, too, but there are things in this world stronger than the both of us.~
@393  = ~You always do, but still...~
@394  = ~Well, there goes my concentration while I think about that for a while! But somehow I doubt your former captor will be interested in the talents that's making it so difficult for me to think clearly right now.~
@395  = ~(gulp) There goes my concentration for the next little while. But somehow I doubt your former captor will be distracted so easily.~
@396  = ~Ahem. Well, there's a place my brain did not need to go.~
@397  = ~You might not have a choice.~
@398  = ~Power corrupts. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. Be careful what you wish for. Those sayings might be trite, but that does not make them untrue.~
@399  = ~There's a chilling thought. With your unique heritage, there's no telling what you could do with that kind of power.~
@400  = ~Ah, that would be the famous <CHARNAME> wit.~
@401  = ~Heh. Clever.~
@402  = ~Heh. Clever and biting. Should I be amused?~
@403  = ~Anything is possible, I suppose.~
@404  = ~I can't say I blame him.~
@405  = ~If so, he has good taste, my dear.~
@406  = ~Yes, because the whole world desires you... and they probably do.~
@407  = ~It still sounds odd, though. He could have just invited you to an evening party.~
@408  = ~That's good to know. But it makes sense. You've made it this far.~
@409  = ~You always were resourceful.~
@410  = ~You always were resourceful. That's just one of the things I love about you.~
@411  = ~Probably. They seldom do.~
@412  = ~Ah, so that was his name.~
@413  = ~You've mentioned him before.~
@414  = ~Whatever his faults may have been, he did a fine job raising you.~
@415  = ~Fathers do that, I'm told. At least mine did. Still, I'm not your father, and I take the hint.~
@416  = ~If he did, it was probably because he cared about you, but I can understand how you would resent the intrusion. And I take the hint.~
@417  = ~Heh. I'm sure he thought he was doing his best to raise you properly. Still, I am not your father, and I take the hint.~
@418  = ~In that case, thank you.~
@419  = ~Nevertheless, I take it that is not a favorable comparison?~
@420  = ~He was a good man, but he did tend to preach a bit.~
@421  = ~He was a jailor as much as a foster father, always prying into my affairs.~
@422  = ~He was a tedious old windbag.~
@423  = ~It's more flattering than you think. He was a kind mentor, and I cared for him deeply.~
@424  = ~Whatever else he may be, your captor was powerful. You're no child, but you might not be a match for him yet.~
@425  = ~I'll stand by you against whatever peril comes, but even together, I don't know if we're strong enough.~
@426  = ~Even if I didn't love you so absolutely, I'd stand by you against whatever peril comes, but even together, I don't know if we're strong enough.~
@427  = ~The best advice I can give you is to do everything you can to make sure you're ready if your paths cross again. Study, train, whatever it takes. I understand your need is grave, but don't force an encounter until you're confident that you'll succeed.~
@428  = ~It's possible. Even the most powerful spellcasters exhaust their reserves, eventually. But he'll have rested since then, and the next time you face him, he might be at full strength again. Have you given much thought to what you'll do if that happens?~
@429  = ~Neither do I. I hate to bring it up, but have you given much thought to what you'll do if your paths cross again?~
@430  = ~I should imagine not. Thank you for trusting me enough to tell me.~
@431  = ~No. I'd be lying if I said your revelation didn't concern me, but you didn't incinerate me on sight, so you must have some control.~
@432  = ~My immediate concern is what you'll do if your paths cross again. Have you given it much thought?~
@433  = ~We'll see to it at once.~
@434  = ~When I left the Sword Coast behind me, I had hoped that I traveled to a more enlightened place, but instead, I find just as much prejudice here as I did in Baldur's Gate... or even more.~ [bgav106]
@435  = ~Why would you expect such a foolish thing? People are people, no matter where they live.~
@436  = ~Tell me about it. I've had more stares since I arrived here than ever I got back in Baldur's Gate.~
@437  = ~We're here because we've got a job to do, not because we're trying to convert the populace to Lathander.~
@438  = ~You've been helping me, Gavin, not spreading your faith. I'm grateful for everything you do, but we have been focused on other things.~
@439  = ~It is discouraging, isn't it?~
@440  = ~I think we are in a more enlightened place. It's better for each race to keep to its own kind.~
@441  = ~I know, but that doesn't excuse it.~
@442  = ~I can't say I'm surprised. There are even times I find myself staring at you, too, and I'm your companion...~
@443  = ~I can't say I'm surprised, and I don't think it's because you're a <PRO_RACE>. There are even times I find myself staring at you, too, and I'm your companion...~
@444  = ~I can't say I'm surprised, and I don't think it's because you're an elf. There are even times I find myself staring at you, too, and I'm your companion...~
@445  = ~That sounded much better in my head. What I mean is that you're easy to look at...~
@446  = ~Whew, this just gets better and better.~
@447  = ~I know I can't stop looking at you, and I don't ever want to try, but everyone can't share my tastes, thank goodness...~
@448  = ~That's because you're an oddity.~
@449  = ~That didn't come out right.~
@450  = ~My point is that there is something about you that almost compels people to look at you. I don't mean this in an offensive way. I just mean that you are profoundly different than most people you meet, and you and I both know why.~
@451  = ~And no, I don't think everyone who sees you knows who and what you are. It's just that maybe they can sense that there is something different about you, and they stare out of curiosity.~
@452  = ~'Who and what' I am? What is that supposed to mean?~
@453  = ~All right, but that doesn't explain why you're always looking at me.~
@454  = ~It isn't fair. I have no control over my ancestry.~
@455  = ~Not everyone sees me with your eyes, Gavin. To them, I'm nothing special.~
@456  = ~You'd think people would find other things to look at. There are far odder-looking people than me on the street.~
@457  = ~You got side-tracked again. You were talking about how you're finding Amn to be as narrow-minded as you found the Sword Coast.~
@458  = ~I... I heard a rumor. I don't usually go around listening to gossip or prying into peoples' past, so please don't think I'm being intrusive, but that kind of thing makes an impression.~
@459  = ~Don't believe everything you hear.~
@460  = ~Well, it's true. Do you hate me now?~
@461  = ~That's a despicable lie. You should be ashamed of yourself for ever believing such a thing.~
@462  = ~So you heard a rumor. And now you think that just because you believe something to be true, so does everyone else.~
@463  = ~Thank you for trusting me enough to tell me. It can't have been easy for you to do.~
@464  = ~I'm sorry. That was a terrible accusation I made against you, and I apologize.~
@465  = ~I don't know whether to believe it or not... and 'don't believe everything you hear' is not exactly a denial. But if you are the child of Bhaal, don't you think I have a right to know?~
@466  = ~I'm not.~
@467  = ~No, I don't, but it isn't because I don't value your company. This isn't the first time someone has asked. Even if I deny it, you'll think I am, anyway.~
@468  = ~I suppose you do. It's true.~
@469  = ~No.~
@470  = ~(sigh) I really hoped you weren't going to follow up on that lapse. I'm going to try to put this as delicately as I can.~
@471  = ~I'm a man. No matter how much I try to confine myself to... er... higher beliefs and ideals, I'm... oh, damn.~
@472  = ~Our friend is trying to tell you that, while he strives to conduct himself with all possible decorum, he is incapable of ignoring the attractions you hold.~
@473  = ~Have mercy, <CHARNAME>! Our fumbling friend is trying to tell you that he finds your countenance agreeable.~
@474  = ~Har, har! The lad's got a pike in his leggin's for ye, but he's too bashful to say it.~
@475  = ~Come, my hound, can you not tell her that you find her face fair to look upon?~
@476  = ~What the oaf is trying and failing to say is that he finds you comely. (Could my opinion of this baboon's eloquence, or lack thereof, sink any lower?)~
@477  = ~Friend Gavin is trying to tell you that he thinks you're pretty.~
@478  = ~Just say it, Gavin. She's a woman and you're attracted to her.~
@479  = ~Interesting. Among animals, males rarely have difficulty communicating their desires to the females. Though perhaps, in this case, there is only attraction, rather than an active desire to mate.~
@480  = ~Reminds me of the time my cousin Todo took a shine to that girl in Sweetheart Lane. Couldn't get an intelligible sentence out of him for a week.~
@481  = ~Get a grip on yourself, man. This is no time to be bothering our leader with oafish flatteries.~
@482  = ~Ilmater's mercy, I don't believe the words that come out of my mouth. Forgive me.~
@483  = ~Can we please return to what we were talking about in the first place? I said that I couldn't believe how prejudiced Amn is and you agreed.~
@484  = ~After that, there was an embarassing display of my ability to humiliate myself, and now, I'd like to go back to talking about Amn... or anything else, really.~
@485  = ~I think I'm done talking for a while.~
@486  = ~Don't worry, Gavin. I find your awkwardness endearing.~
@487  = ~Right... Amn... Prejudice. Yes, I agree. I hadn't expected to find so much of it here, either.~
@488  = ~I don't know if things are any worse here, but I didn't really expect them to be better. People are still people, even if you cross a border.~
@489  = ~Actually, I didn't agree. I'm just as happy if things are the way they are. Each race should keep to its own kind.~
@490  = ~I'm sorry my ill-considered words put an end to this discussion, but I understand your desire to keep moving.~
@491  = ~Well, that's something, at least. I keep hoping that one day, I'll grow out of it, but it hasn't happened yet.~
@492  = ~Anyway...~
@493  = ~In any case, I'd be a hypocrite if I based my opinion of a person on ancestry alone, no matter how... different it might be.~
@494  = ~Oh, I know. None of us can.~
@495  = ~No doubt! And ones less...~
@496  = ~Yes, yes. But it isn't fair for people to judge based on appearances.~
@497  = ~'Ones less' what, Gavin?~
@498  = ~Yes, that's right, I was.~
@499  = ~You will always be something special, love. If others don't see that, they're blind, but I won't complain about that. If they weren't, I might have to fight another for your honor every time we went out of doors.~
@500  = ~But it is troubling that people are so quick to judge.~
@501  = ~I know, but it's hard to see so much inequity around us and feel anything but disappointment.~
@502  = ~With so much inequity around us, it's hard to feel anything but disappointment.~
@503  = ~You don't really believe that, do you?~
@504  = ~I do. Very firmly.~
@505  = ~It isn't that I have anything against <PRO_RACE> and non-<PRO_RACE> living side by side, but I fear that culture may be lost forever, should each race lose its identity.~
@506  = ~I've got nothing against your average non-<PRO_RACE>, but <PRO_RACE> and non-<PRO_RACE> should never wed.~
@507  = ~No, I probably spoke too hastily. I'm not really that biased.~
@508  = ~I'm sorry you feel that way. I pray that one day, you'll reconsider.~
@509  = ~That's a valid concern, <CHARNAME>. We all should keep the best of what we are, our faith, our culture, our art, and strive to rid ourselves of the worst, distrust, hate, war.~
@510  = ~I see. I would never tell another where he should give his heart, but it seems wrong to me that one <PRO_RACE> could only find happiness with another <PRO_RACE>. Yet in matters of love, moreso than anywhere else, each person must follow what he believes to be right.~
@511  = ~We all do that, from time to time. No harm done.~
@512  = ~A person's actions define them, not the shape of the ears or the blood in the veins.~
@513  = ~Lathander teaches us that, but damn me, I can't seem to help people understand it. There are times when I feel like such a failure for not being able to get that simple point across.~
@514  = ~Lathander also teaches us to guide, rather than compel. We can't force people to adhere to our beliefs.~
@515  = ~Would Lathander really advocate trying to force people to adhere to a set of beliefs?~
@516  = ~Maybe you just aren't persuasive enough.~
@517  = ~You have to believe in yourself. If you don't, no one else will.~
@518  = ~You can't change the world in a day, Gavin. You just need more time.~
@519  = ~Why bother? If people want to believe that they're better than everyone else, you can always laugh at them when they're proven wrong.~
@520  = ~The world is a big place, and you're just one man.~
@521  = ~Why are you worrying about this when you're supposed to be helping me with my quest?~
@522  = ~You're right. Failed again.~
@523  = ~Now there's an understatement.~
@524  = ~'Always another morning?'~
@525  = ~Heh. And I guess it starts with me, doesn't it?~
@526  = ~You're right, of course.~
@527  = ~I worry about it because it's a tenet of my faith... but you're right. I should be more worried about your quest.~
@528  = ~I try, <CHARNAME>, I try, but sometimes, it isn't easy.~
@529  = ~There are days, sometimes, when I don't think I can do anything right.~
@530  = ~You're only human, Gavin. You shouldn't expect so much from yourself.~
@531  = ~And there are days when you seem to do the impossible. It all balances out in the end.~
@532  = ~This isn't like you, Gavin. You're not usually this negative.~

@865  = ~Point taken.~
@866  = ~That's an overly simple analogy, don't you think?~
@867  = ~So, it exists because you remember it. But what of the coin in my pouch? You've never seen it. Does it exist?~
@868  = ~But that doesn't matter. I've made my point. There are a lot of things we have to take on faith, and a lot more is possible than we ever dreamed could be.~
@869  = ~So, you'll take my word for it because I can see and touch it. But what of the coin in my pouch? For all I know, it fell out days ago. Does that exist?~
@870  = ~Yes, there are a lot of things we have to take on faith. More is possible than we ever dreamed could be.~
@871  = ~Is it? It's hard to get more simple than a thing's existence, but even that is by no means certain. Consider the coin in my pouch. You've never seen it, or heard me mention it before now. Does it exist?~
@872  = ~The reality of emotion as proof of the intangible. I like that. It's a lot deeper than it seems on the surface, because emotions can be so easily misconstrued. Is it disappointment, or is it boredom? An observer might not be able to tell, but that makes it no less real.~
@873  = ~You've got more wisdom than many, to understand that.~
@874  = ~No games, <CHARNAME>, though perhaps you tire of this conversation. Let's catch up with the others, then.~
@875  = ~It also tends to deflect the question. Nevermind. I'll leave you be.~
@876  = ~I'd like to believe that, too.~
@877  = ~I'm a little surprised to hear you say it, though.~
@878  = ~I haven't had a normal life, Gavin. If things had been different, I'm sure I wouldn't have turned out the way I did.~

@883  = ~It's never too late to change, and even the oldest wound can be persuaded to heal, with the right medicine. You just have to believe it's possible.~
@884  = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>, why must you say these things? But I can't give up hope. I must not.~
@885  = ~I'm not surprised to hear you say that, but it's good to hear, nonetheless.~

@891  = ~Do you really believe that, despite things that others have done for you, with no hope of reward? Do you really think people are evil by nature?~
@892  = ~No, not really.~
@893  = ~How disappointing. I had hoped you would not be so cynical.~
@894  = ~I've tried to be better. My actions haven't always been good, and I'm ashamed of that, but I've always intended to do the right thing.~
@895  = ~Wishing won't change a person's nature.~

@898  = ~I had a lot of love and support while I was growing up, though. Most didn't, and if they turned out worse, I wouldn't blame them for it.~
@899  = ~Everyone makes mistakes. Maybe there are some that just keep making them, even if they want to do better.~

@918  = ~When this happens, I need you to promise you won't try to raise me.~
@919  = ~I'll do nothing of the kind! The gods bestow the power to raise the dead for a reason.~
@920  = ~Why would you ask such a thing of me?~
@921  = ~Nothing will happen to you, if I have any say in the matter.~
@922  = ~But what of us? What of our love?~
@923  = ~I know this is important to you. I will do as you ask.~
@924  = ~I can't make you that promise.~
@925  = ~We have to discuss it. I'm sorry, but it isn't something we can ignore.~
@926  = ~There is no better time than the present. I hope it will not take long.~
@927  = ~The gods bestow the power to raise the dead for a number of reasons, but... let me explain.~
@928  = ~We who follow Lathander believe that the souls of the faithful return to Lathander. We consider it coming home to our god. We dwell with him for a time, then are returned to the mortal world in the bodies of newborns, completing the Great Cycle that begins and ends with birth.~
@929  = ~Raising interrupts that cycle, returning the soul to the world of the living without the solace of a homecoming.~
@930  = ~The only time this is condoned is if the deceased has unfinished business here on Toril.~
@931  = ~So, if you have 'unfinished business,' you could be raised?~
@932  = ~And who decides that you have left work undone?~
@933  = ~But what of our love? Isn't that reason enough to come back?~
@934  = ~I understand. I'll do as you ask.~
@935  = ~I'm sorry, Gavin. I can't make any promises. I'd like to follow your wishes, but if I still need you, I'm going to have to attempt to raise you.~
@936  = ~No. I won't agree to anything so foolish.~
@937  = ~That spares me some guilt, at least. Now I just have to find a convenient way for you to die.~
@938  = ~I'm glad you're looking out for me, but I leave all in Lathander's hands. If it's his will that I should return to him, there is no force on Toril that could prevent it, and if it is his will that I remain here, then I have nothing to worry about.~
@939  = ~And if it's his will that you be raised, you would accept that as readily?~
@940  = ~Alright, but why are you determined not to be raised?~
@941  = ~I know this is important to you, so I will do as you ask.~
@942  = ~I can't make you any promises.~
@943  = ~<CHARNAME>, beloved, please do not ask me to choose between you and my faith! Maybe I should explain.~
@944  = ~I am relieved, though I understand that if my time comes while I am with you, new questions might arise. If that happens, you'll get answers from High Mornmaster Arval at the Temple in Athkatla.~
@945  = ~All I can ask is that you consider my wishes, should I fall in your service. If that happens, you can seek the advice of High Mornmaster Arval at the Temple in Athkatla. He may be able to explain things in a way you find easier to understand.~
@946  = ~Perhaps, though if I've fallen in battle, I would be in no position to say whether I had work left to do.~
@947  = ~I would consider my death as a sign that my work on Toril was done... though I am not arrogant enough to say whether Lathander would agree or disagree.~
@948  = ~It is hard, <CHARNAME>. Since Lathander does permit resurrection, who am I to say whether death is a final reward or a test of faith?~
@949  = ~Under the circumstances, I would prefer to leave the decision in the hands of those better schooled in my faith than I. High Mornmaster Arval would be able to answer these questions that I cannot.~
@950  = ~(sigh) I would want it, though my faith itself forbade it... though perhaps I am not the one who should make that decision.~
@951  = ~<CHARNAME>... please...~
@952  = ~Ha! You always were a clever one, <CHARNAME>, and always ready with a good joke...~
@953  = ~That was a joke, wasn't it?~
@954  = ~There is one other matter, and it is more important than my continued existence on Toril.~
@955  = ~Lanie resides at the Temple of Oghma in the Docks. Should I fall, please tell the priest of Oghma. He will break the news to Lanie, and notify my family in Ulgoth's Beard and Mornmaster Ormlyr at the Song of the Morning.~
@956  = ~What will happen to Lanie if you die?~
@957  = ~If you die, I'll tell him.~
@958  = ~We'll see.~
@959  = ~If I even remember.~
@960  = ~She will finish her studies and then she will go to my brother Gordon in Ulgoth's Beard. He has a family of his own, and I know that he and his wife will love Lanie as if she were their daughter.~
@961  = ~Thank you for agreeing to do this for me.~
@962  = ~Please, <CHARNAME>, this is no time for jest, assuming it is a jest. This is a child's life we're talking about.~
@963  = ~Please... you're in Athkatla all the time. It isn't too much to ask.~
@964  = ~<CHARNAME>, have you ever seen something you've wanted to forget, but couldn't?~ [bgav109]
@965  = ~Yes, that time you decided to sluice off in that stream. Some things are better left unseen.~
@966  = ~How can you even ask that, knowing what I've been through?~
@967  = ~I'll worry more when I can see horrors and forget them.~
@968  = ~Not really. Bad things happen, even monstrous things. It doesn't do you any good to dwell on them.~
@969  = ~Would it help to talk about it?~
@970  = ~Here we go again. Gavin cries tears of blood for some fool too stupid to stay out of trouble. You should have been a priest of Ilmater.~
@971  = ~Heh. I didn't realize anyone could see me. Sorry about that.~
@972  = ~Ilmater's blood, I didn't realize anyone could see me. I'm sorry.~
@973  = ~Don't apologize. I liked what I saw. It's just that the memory is rather distracting.~
@974  = ~Don't apologize. I liked what I saw. It's just that with the way things are between us...~
@975  = ~Next time, you might want to look around before you take your clothes off.~
@976  = ~It isn't fair to show me things like that when I'm supposed to have my mind on someone else.~
@977  = ~So how did you get that scar on your back?~
@978  = ~There's something about you that I find repellent.~
@979  = ~No offense. I prefer women.~
@980  = ~You did? I mean... er... yes, but it's the principle of the thing...~
@981  = ~Ahem.~
@982  = ~Nothing is broken beyond all mending, but we can talk about that later, if you like.~
@983  = ~Yes, some things are broken beyond all mending.~
@984  = ~I thought I did.~
@985  = ~Er... yes.~
@986  = ~When we were boys, Calahan and my brother were pretending to be Hurgan Stoneblade and throwing axes. Calahan missed.~
@987  = ~Good to know... I guess.~
@988  = ~Oh, no. Do you... did you find the sight repulsive?~
@989  = ~Not at all! It's just that seeing you that way has made it a bit hard for me to think about other things, like my quest.~
@990  = ~It does make me wonder what you'd look like if the water weren't so cold.~
@991  = ~No, it's just that I thought we were saving that until after we're married. Now you've gone and spoiled the surprise.~
@992  = ~Let's just say that when the time comes, we'll be blowing out all the lamps.~
@993  = ~And we can't be having that, now, can we, love?~
@994  = ~Much different. Much, much different. Ahem.~
@995  = ~Oh, love, I'm sorry. Honestly, I didn't realize you could see me.~
@996  = ~Wonderful.~
@997  = ~Beshaba's breath. There's only one thing I've got that you'll accept, and you can't stand the sight of me?~
@998  = ~I thought you'd be more manly. Your chest is as hairless as a babe's.~
@999  = ~In the dark, all cats are gray.~
@1000 = ~Just give the word when you want me to come to you, then.~
@1001 = ~I spend years of my life making sure my body is fit and strong, and she complains because I haven't got a pelt.~
@1002 = ~Ilmater's blood, I thought...~
@1003 = ~Oh, no! I enjoyed the view. It's just that seeing you that way has made it a bit hard for me to think about other things, like my quest.~
@1004 = ~(giggle) Don't worry. I know it was just the cold water.~
@1005 = ~If I saw you, anybody else could have, too. I thought that you only showed off for me.~
@1006 = ~There's a good reason I like it better when the lamps are out.~
@1007 = ~Is that so? Maybe we'll have to do something about that later, yes?~
@1008 = ~That's right... cold water.~
@1009 = ~I do... well, not showing off, exactly...~
@1010 = ~<CHARNAME>, love, I was filthy. I really needed a bath. There was really nothing more to it than that.~
@1011 = ~You've never complained before.~
@1012 = ~I'm not complaining now! It's just that seeing you that way has made it a bit hard for me to think about other things, like my quest.~
@1013 = ~Usually, the only time I see you naked is before you come to bed. Seeing you out in the open like that, all pale and hairless, well...~
@1014 = ~If you want me to come to you when you retire, say so, and I'll be there.~
@1015 = ~I... I'm sorry. After everything you've been through, for me to make such a stupid remark... I'm sorry.~
@1016 = ~And you have, too.~
@1017 = ~But sometimes, you can't help it... but you've seen worse than I. And I'm an idiot.~
@1018 = ~When I left your company, not long after we met, Lanie and I went to the Temple of Oghma. On the way, I saw a group of ruffians assaulting a prostitute, laughing while they beat her. She was crying, begging for help, and no one paid her any heed.~
@1019 = ~I did nothing to help her. I just picked Lanie up and carried her past, hiding her face so she wouldn't see what was happening. But she had to have heard it.~
@1020 = ~When we finally got to the temple and I put her down, she just looked at me, silent and grave. 'You saw and you did nothing,' her eyes said to me, and I had no answer.~
@1021 = ~I don't know what haunts me more, the viciousness of the attack, the indifference of the passers-by, or the accusation in my child's eyes.~
@1022 = ~What could you have done? You couldn't have left Lanie alone to help the girl. Someone would have stolen her away.~
@1023 = ~You made a mistake. You should have gone back once you saw that Lanie was safe.~
@1024 = ~You could have called the guard, at least.~
@1025 = ~What's done is done. Guilt will only drive you mad.~
@1026 = ~This is Athkatla, Gavin. People see worse every day.~
@1027 = ~What do you care what happens to some whore?~
@1028 = ~That was my fear, as well. Unattended children are not safe in Athkatla.~
@1029 = ~I tried going back to see if the woman was all right, but by the time I found a monk to watch Lanie for a moment, the fight was over. She was gone, and there was nothing but blood on the paving stones to show that any wrong had ever been done. I asked where she went, or if she was even alive, but no one would answer. No one seemed to care.~
@1030 = ~What guard? I saw none from the moment I entered the Docks.~
@1031 = ~It may, and it should. I felt helpless.~
@1032 = ~And that's the worst part. They see worse and do nothing. When I finally found a monk to watch Lanie for a moment, I went back, but the fight was over, and no one would tell me where the woman went or even if she was still alive. No one seemed to care.~
@1033 = ~Someone has to care, because it doesn't seem like anyone else will. When I finally found a monk to watch Lanie for a moment, I went back, but the fight was over, and no one would tell me where the woman went or even if she was still alive. It was like nothing had ever happened.~
@1034 = ~Are you indifferent to the suffering of others, or are you just mocking my sympathetic nature?~
@1035 = ~You get upset about things no sane person would think twice about. You have to toughen up, Gavin, because the world is too harsh a place for tender fools like you.~
@1036 = ~I'm only saying this for your own good. You let things bother you, and they shouldn't. You can't change the world, Gavin, so you're going to have to steel yourself against some of its injustices.~
@1037 = ~I'm not doing either. I know you want to help everyone, and maybe you even think you can. I envy your optimism, but I don't want to see you get hurt.~
@1038 = ~Now why would you think I'm mocking you? Could it be because you never open your mouth except to spout some preachy bilge about the rights of the downtrodden?~
@1039 = ~This conversation is over.~
@1040 = ~I can't do that. I won't do that.~
@1041 = ~People get hurt every day, and so must I.~

@1044 = ~I know you see things that bother you, Gavin, but you're going to have to learn to live with them.~
@1045 = ~We're working toward a greater goal, and we can't afford to lose sight of that.~
@1046 = ~Don't go to pieces on me now, Gavin. I need you focused on *my* plans, not worrying about what you may have done or said in a past life.~
@1047 = ~You're going to have to find a way, because I haven't got time to hold your hand through the rough patches.~
@1048 = ~I'm not sure I can.~
@1049 = ~I don't know if I can.~
@1050 = ~We can't afford to ignore the plight of individuals, either.~
@1051 = ~Then there's nothing left to say.~
@1052 = ~But for all that, I haven't lived the life you've lived, or experienced the nightmares that plague you. So, when memories surface to haunt me, I have no way to shut them out.~
@1053 = ~It's all some kind of slavery. Children are stolen, or bought and sold, prostitutes are treated like property, and everyone just goes on about their lives like nothing's wrong. Some of it is even legal, and that's what really makes me sick.~
@1054 = ~So what are you going to do about it?~
@1055 = ~I know, Gavin. It upsets me, too. We can fight the slavers, at least.~
@1056 = ~I'm sorry you're so upset, but the system works. Some sacrifices must be made to uphold order.~
@1057 = ~I'm telling you, Gavin, the problem is that there are too many rules. If people were left to sort it all out themselves, they wouldn't have the problems they have now.~
@1058 = ~If something is wrong, it isn't the legal system. The strong thrive, the weak do their bidding. This is natural and right.~
@1059 = ~Has anyone ever told you that you think too much?~
@1060 = ~Thank you for telling me what's been bothering you, Gavin. I wish I had the answers, but I don't.~
@1061 = ~There's nothing I can do. Not now.~
@1062 = ~And if we beat them back, more will come to take their place.~
@1063 = ~<CHARNAME>, a woman may have been beaten to death on the street. There is no order.~
@1064 = ~It hasn't been working too well, so far, but there's always hope, always another tomorrow.~
@1065 = ~With some regularity.~
@1066 = ~I don't either, but there's always hope.~
@1067 = ~If there's ever going to be change, it will be because peoples' attitudes have changed, the way they think. Making laws won't work, breaking them won't help. Every person has to believe that better things are possible and that all creatures deserve the chance to grow and prosper.~
@1068 = ~We can guide, but if the change is going to mean anything, it has to come from within.~

@1081 = ~I understand how that goes. Simply surviving from one day to the next takes it out of you.~
@1082 = ~I never know whether you're serious when you talk like that. For my own sanity, I'm going to assume you're not. In any case, I was talking about how people need something in their lives that they can rely on.~
@1083 = ~Ha! Careful, <CHARNAME>, or I'll start thinking you've been letting nefarious forces influence you. Kidding aside, everyone needs someone, some constant in their lives.~
@1084 = ~That's a pity.~
@1085 = ~I'm glad to be counted in that company, then. But in a way, it's unfortunate, because we're all affected by the things that affect you.~

@1124 = ~I'm the master of my own destiny, Gavin. My blood does not rule me.~
@1125 = ~You make much of my taint, but I don't think I'm much different than anyone else.~
@1126 = ~I can feel it, sometimes, like there's this dark core of energy inside me. All that potential, all that power, all waiting for me to find a way to tap it.~
@1127 = ~All anyone ever wants to talk about is my heritage. I'm getting tired of it.~
@1128 = ~And there's something about you... I can't quite identify what it is. It's as if your destiny is greater than the rest of ours, or as if you have powers the rest of us don't.~
@1129 = ~I'm the master of my own destiny, Gavin. Whatever power I may have, I'm the one who decides what to do with it.~
@1130 = ~I don't feel any different than anyone else.~
@1131 = ~I'm the child of Bhaal, Gavin.~
@1132 = ~Right. I guess I know what I'm doing tonight. Now, about that head... the pressure must really be getting to you.~
@1133 = ~(sigh) I guess there's still time for improvement.~
@1134 = ~Good for you! Good for all of us.~
@1135 = ~How would you know?~
@1136 = ~Er... that came out wrong. My point is that you have no reference for comparison. You've never been any other way.~
@1137 = ~That does NOT sound healthy. Resist it, <CHARNAME>... please.~
@1138 = ~It certainly sets you apart. Is it so strange that others would be curious about it?~
@1139 = ~I'm sorry, I don't think I heard you right. I thought you just said you're a child of Bhaal.~
@1140 = ~I'm sorry, Gavin. I should have told you sooner.~
@1141 = ~That's what I said. I'm a Bhaalspawn.~
@1142 = ~You need to clean the wax out of your ears. I said I'm the child of Gaal.~
@1143 = ~You need to clean the wax out of your ears. I said I'm the child of Paal.~
@1144 = ~Sorry, <CHARNAME>, this is a lot to take in all at once. Why didn't you tell me sooner?~
@1145 = ~Because I knew you would treat me differently. As soon as anyone finds out, they treat me like a monster... or worse, a specimen to be studied.~
@1146 = ~It never came up in conversation.~
@1147 = ~It isn't really the kind of thing you announce.~
@1148 = ~The lunatic in the Temple District?~
@1149 = ~Never heard of him.~
@1150 = ~He was a very prominent wizard around here once, known for unorthodox experimentation on prisoners.~
@1151 = ~He was involved in some unusually ruthless business dealings a while back. He's dead, but I don't think his victims would mind revenging themselves upon his kin.~
@1152 = ~You're one of the few, then.~
@1153 = ~He invented the spoon. I never tell anyone for fear that I'll be swarmed by admirers.~
@1154 = ~I can understand that.~
@1155 = ~I would have thought you might have found a reason to bring it up... or maybe not.~
@1156 = ~No, I imagine not.~
@1157 = ~In that case, I can understand your desire to keep your ancestry secret.~
@1158 = ~I'll count myself fortunate, I guess. Your father must have been notorious, if you won't even say what he did.~
@1159 = ~Heh. Fine, keep your secrets.~
@1160 = ~If my reaction was typical, I can only imagine how difficult it must have been for you to find acceptance anywhere.~
@1161 = ~So, what are your plans, going forward?~
@1162 = ~Do whatever good I can... or at least do as little ill as possible.~
@1163 = ~Survive, be strong, and take each day as it comes. Tomorrow has to be better than today.~
@1164 = ~Learn to harness this power, and turn it to my advantage.~
@1165 = ~I have no idea.~
@1166 = ~We can do this. I know we can.~
@1167 = ~Oh, no. There are just so many ways that can go wrong... for yourself as much as everyone else.~
@1168 = ~Neither do I.~
@1169 = ~Where in the nine hells is my shaving mirror?~ [bgav112]
@1170 = ~Where did you have it last?~

@1172 = ~How should I know?~
@1173 = ~Have you ever thought that just maybe you should grow a beard?~
@1174 = ~Just a moment, Gavin, and I'll help you look for it.~
@1175 = ~If it was up your ass you'd know it.~
@1176 = ~What kind of an answer is that? I'm looking for my mirror, not grooming tips.~
@1177 = ~If I knew that, I wouldn't be looking for it now, would I?~
@1178 = ~You borrowed it. That's just great. How do you shave when you can't take someone else's things?~
@1179 = ~You borrowed it? Why? You don't need to shave. Oh, that's right. Check the hair, check the face, and have I got anything stuck in my teeth? Women. And what do you do when you can't take someone else's things?~
@1180 = ~Well, somebody must, because I sure don't!~
@1181 = ~I don't see what good that will do. I've already looked everywhere.~
@1182 = ~And I suppose you think that's clever. Wise-ass remarks are the last thing I need.~
@1183 = ~And here it is, right on top of your pack. So, did you think you'd just open up my pack, root around a while, and pull out the first thing I'd miss just to jest with me? Or did you just assume you could take anything you like without bothering to ask?~
@1184 = ~That's the problem with you, and with everyone else, it seems. 'There's old Gavin. He's such a sport. He won't mind a little bit of fun.' Or 'He's such a pushover. He won't be fussed if I just help myself to whatever he's got.' Hmf!~
@1185 = ~This really isn't like you, Gavin. Is something wrong?~
@1186 = ~Whoa! Who put salt in your coffee?~
@1187 = ~Gavin, you're scaring me. I've never seen you like this before.~
@1188 = ~It was just a mirror!~
@1189 = ~Oh, that's right! I found it on the ground last night and put it there for safekeeping. I meant to give it back, but I must have forgotten.~
@1190 = ~Aye, something's wrong!~
@1191 = ~Aye, blame it all on me! If there's a problem, it must be my fault!~
@1192 = ~Well, it's about time I stood up for myself.~
@1193 = ~Aye, it's just a mirror. But it's MY mirror.~
@1194 = ~Pft! If you expect me to believe that, you must think me gullible beyond all measure.~
@1195 = ~That's the problem around here. I get no respect. I give and I give, and for what? So everybody can take me for granted.~
@1196 = ~I don't take you for granted, Gavin. You're a valuable member of this group.~
@1197 = ~You're making too much of this.~
@1198 = ~I'm sorry you're so upset, but this is really no way to behave.~
@1199 = ~I'm starting to think that getting involved with you is a bad idea.~
@1200 = ~I'm starting to think that our engagement may be a bad idea.~
@1201 = ~You're right. You don't get any respect, and the reason you don't is because you throw tantrums like this!~
@1202 = ~I'm going to walk away now, and I don't want to talk to you again until you've calmed down.~
@1203 = ~Just shut up. Right now.~
@1204 = ~As long as I do everything you say and never complain. Bah.~
@1205 = ~What? Just because I finally decide to stand up for myself, for a change? Forget it, <CHARNAME>.~
@1206 = ~I'll behave any damn way I want.~
@1207 = ~Yeah? Well, maybe I am, too.~
@1208 = ~My thoughts exactly.~
@1209 = ~You can say that again. I never should have agreed to it in the first place.~
@1210 = ~This isn't a tantrum! Maybe you don't want to hear what I'm saying, but I should have said it a long time ago.~
@1211 = ~Hmf!~
@1212 = ~<CHARNAME>, I need to apologize for my outburst earlier. I know I said some terrible things, and I'm sorry, but I couldn't seem to stop.~ [bgav113]
@1213 = ~We all have bad days.~
@1214 = ~I understand, and I forgive you.~
@1215 = ~That's what happens when you keep everything bottled up. Sooner or later, you're going to blow.~
@1216 = ~I don't know, Gavin. You said some terrible things.~
@1217 = ~You might regret it now, but what is said can never be unsaid.~
@1218 = ~It's too late for apologies now.~
@1219 = ~So, you're not just rude, you're spineless, too. 'Sorry' is for the weak.~
@1220 = ~Maybe, but not everyone makes a capital offense of a misplaced mirror.~
@1221 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>.~
@1222 = ~Well, that's certainly what I did earlier.~
@1223 = ~I did, and I should have had better self-control than that.~
@1224 = ~Does that mean...~
@1225 = ~It means that I don't think as highly of you as I once did, and no longer welcome your attention.~
@1226 = ~It means that I no longer want to marry you.~
@1227 = ~It means that I won't be asking you to my bed any time soon, or ever again, for that matter.~
@1228 = ~I'll get over it, but give me some time, alright?~
@1229 = ~Oh, I forgive you, but no more outbursts, please.~
@1230 = ~I know...~
@1231 = ~Hardly. Do you have any idea how difficult it is to apologize? But never mind. I suppose forgiveness isn't in your nature, either.~
@1232 = ~It might be. I've never really thought about it.~
@1233 = ~No, it isn't.~
@1234 = ~I'm surprised to hear you say such a thing. We all need forgiveness, sometimes, but I understand if you aren't quite ready to forgive me yet. I'll just keep hoping that you can soon.~
@1235 = ~Well... thing is...~
@1236 = ~Ah, hells. Can you ever forgive me?~
@1237 = ~I think so. Shake hands?~
@1238 = ~I think so. Shall we kiss and make up?~
@1239 = ~I need some more time.~
@1240 = ~Not this time.~
@1241 = ~Forgiveness is a powerful healer, and I'm grateful.~
@1242 = ~One ill-considered word, and it's all over?~
@1243 = ~I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>. I had no idea...~
@1244 = ~No... I'm sorry.~
@1245 = ~Ah, well, I had hoped it wouldn't be like this, but all things must end.~
@1246 = ~Yes... of course.~
@1247 = ~Well, do so, please. And I'm not just saying that because I want you to forgive me. You'll feel better about yourself, too.~
@1248 = ~Alright, I forgive you.~
@1249 = ~No, I'm not ready for that.~
@1250 = ~Ah, well. I had to try.~
@1251 = ~Gladly! Thank you, <CHARNAME>.~
@1252 = ~(Gavin's lips barely graze yours before he retreats.)~
@1253 = ~I... I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>... I'm just not in the right frame of mind for this.~

@1255 = ~(Gavin kisses you soundly, holding you in a close embrace.)~
@1256 = ~Er... yes... if you like.~
@1257 = ~(Gavin's lips brush yours lightly, but he quickly steps away.)~
@1258 = ~Sorry, <CHARNAME>, I wasn't really prepared for a request like that.~
@1259 = ~Er... no, I don't really think that would be appropriate, even under the circumstances.~
@1260 = ~What the hells.~
@1261 = ~(Gavin leans in and kisses you soundly, if self-consciously.)~
@1262 = ~Then time you shall have.~

@1264 = ~You're hardly the same person you were, when I first joined your company.~ [bgav114]
@1265 = ~Sadder but wiser?~
@1266 = ~I know we've been living under some pretty harsh conditions, but I'd hope I haven't grown ugly yet.~

@1268 = ~I certainly don't feel like the same person.~
@1269 = ~You're imagining things. I'm still the same person I was.~
@1270 = ~Hardly!~
@1271 = ~You're... mighty! You're more powerful than I would have thought possible, for one.~
@1272 = ~That doesn't say much for your imagination.~
@1273 = ~I knew I could do it. You should have had more faith in me.~
@1274 = ~I knew I could do it. Maybe you just don't believe in me.~
@1275 = ~Does that make you uncomfortable? Some men feel threatened by a powerful woman.~
@1276 = ~I wouldn't have believed it, either.~
@1277 = ~Yet here you are.~
@1278 = ~Not at all! You were always better at everything than me. It's a bit of a thrill, being in the company of someone greater than me, and maybe even being found worthy of notice...~
@1279 = ~You have your charms.~
@1280 = ~So, you're thrilled at being in my company, eh? Does it excite you physically?~
@1281 = ~Er... right.~
@1282 = ~Don't flatter yourself.~
@1283 = ~Not at all! You were always better at everything than me. It's a thrill, being loved by someone greater than me, or even being found worthy of notice...~
@1284 = ~You were always better at everything than me. It's a thrill, pleasuring someone greater than me, having once been found worthy of notice...~
@1285 = ~So, you're physically excited by my power, eh?~
@1286 = ~I'd have thought you'd have noticed... ahem.~
@1287 = ~You have no idea. Ahem.~
@1288 = ~Well, isn't this awkward. Let's go back to talking about you.~
@1289 = ~Er... I'd better not answer that. Let's go back to talking about you. It's far safer.~
@1290 = ~Heh. Well, let's hope you continue to find clumsy priests amusing.~
@1291 = ~You're also loyal, caring, and a good friend.~
@1292 = ~You make me laugh. I like that.~
@1293 = ~And you look good with your shirt off. Don't forget that.~
@1294 = ~I'm hoping you grow out of this awkward phase.~
@1295 = ~Now you're making me blush, so let's go back to talking about you.~
@1296 = ~I'm not sure I like the sound of that, so let's go back to talking about you.~
@1297 = ~No, it isn't like that. It's more...~
@1298 = ~You're more confident, you've become better at your profession, you can do things I wouldn't have thought possible. And while it's no slight on you, it doesn't say much for my own ambition.~
@1299 = ~I've had to work hard to get where I am.~
@1300 = ~You could do more, if you just tried.~
@1301 = ~Sometimes, I wonder what the limits of my abilities even are.~
@1302 = ~That's hard to say.~
@1303 = ~I'm content with the gifts Lathander bestowed on me. He gave me the ability to help others and the desire to do so, so I do what I can. He did not see fit to burden me with pride, and I'm just as happy without it.~
@1304 = ~Are you saying I'm arrogant?~
@1305 = ~I'm happy with some of the other gifts Lathander gave you.~
@1306 = ~Your abilities have been an asset to this group.~
@1307 = ~Whatever.~
@1308 = ~I'm glad I was able to help.~
@1309 = ~You'd better stop that, or the blushing will make me dizzy.~
@1310 = ~But we were talking about you.~
@1311 = ~You've come a long way, in the time I've known you.~
@1312 = ~No, not at all.~
@1313 = ~I know the cost has been heavy for you.~
@1314 = ~It seems like the more I can do, the more I'm expected to do.~
@1315 = ~Too high. I've lost friends, family, any hope of stability, and for what? More responsibilities.~
@1316 = ~It's been worth it, though. Just think of all I can do!~
@1317 = ~I wouldn't have been able to do any of it without help from my friends.~
@1318 = ~We might have helped, but the guiding hand was yours. You paid the price, and you reaped the rewards.~
@1319 = ~It isn't fair that you should have to suffer so much loss, but your sacrifice hasn't been in vain... even if your cares are greater now.~
@1320 = ~That's just the way it goes.~
@1321 = ~It's the way it goes. The more power you have, the more responsibilities you have. More people count on you.~
@1322 = ~So when do I get to be king?~
@1323 = ~So when do I get to be queen?~
@1324 = ~So when do I get to be empress?~
@1325 = ~I don't remember ever being given a choice.~
@1326 = ~I don't mind. At least I know I'm doing something worthwhile.~
@1327 = ~I never asked for it, and I don't want it.~
@1328 = ~No, you weren't ever given a choice, were you?~
@1329 = ~That you are.~
@1330 = ~You are, and that's another thing I wanted to talk to you about.~
@1331 = ~You've made so many changes in your life, you're hardly the <PRO_MANWOMAN> you were, and the change has been for the better. You've grown as a person, and you've become someone I'd be proud to call a friend.~
@1332 = ~It's time to break from the past, to be reborn. Are you ready?~
@1333 = ~I'm ready. I want to be a better person.~
@1334 = ~What do you mean?~
@1335 = ~I need more time to think about it.~
@1336 = ~No, I can't change that much.~
@1337 = ~There's something we need to talk about, though. You know what kind of man I am. I've stayed with you because I hoped that you would change. Maybe you're trying, but I just don't see it happening. I need to know where we stand.~
@1338 = ~I want to change, I really do, but it's hard to do.~
@1339 = ~Then I would have to say that you are ready, after all.~
@1340 = ~I guess that you just aren't ready yet, though I hope that it may happen one day soon.~
@1341 = ~I can't tell you how overjoyed I am that you've embraced this change.~
@1342 = ~If you accept the fact that you aren't the person you were, and choose to continue what you've started, you can become a better person. It really is that simple.~
@1343 = ~Then take the time you need.~
@1344 = ~You know the man I am, though. Some things will have to change.~
@1345 = ~Do you mean you're not ready yet, or do you mean that you never will be ready?~
@1346 = ~I'm not ready yet.~
@1347 = ~I'm not ready, and I never will be.~
@1348 = ~(sigh) I hoped you wouldn't feel that way, but I'll remain in the party, and pray you change your mind.~
@1349 = ~(sigh) I'd really hoped that it wouldn't come down to this, but it has. I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>, but you knew what kind of man I am when I signed on. If I'm to follow my conscience, I can no longer continue in your company. Farewell.~
@1350 = ~Sometimes... Maybe you want to do more. I just don't know. I wish I did, because then I wouldn't have to say what I know that I must.~
@1351 = ~If you need more time, take it, but some things are going to have to change.~
@1352 = ~You never were. No one ever is. Though perhaps that's untrue.~
@1353 = ~You could have just turned your back on everyone who needed you and sought power for your own ends.~
@1354 = ~When I find a vacant throne, I'll let you know.~
@1355 = ~I don't know, but if you do, keep me in mind if you need a jester.~
@1356 = ~You already are, to me.~
@1357 = ~<CHARNAME> the Demigoddess, ruler of worlds. There's a sobering thought.~
@1358 = ~You mean you're not? I thought you must be some kind of royalty, the way you've made me your fool.~
@1359 = ~There's something else I wanted to talk to you about... your attitude is different now than it was when we first met.~
@1360 = ~So, where are we off to now?~ [bgav115]
@1361 = ~Quests, quests, and more quests.~
@1362 = ~We're just finishing a few more things, and then we'll make camp.~
@1363 = ~We're just finishing a few more things, and then we'll find an inn for the night.~
@1364 = ~I don't even know anymore.~
@1365 = ~It never ends. Where's a person supposed to find time for a normal life?~
@1366 = ~That would depend on your definition of normal. This is the only life I've known.~
@1367 = ~Why would I even want a life like that? It sounds boring, if you ask me.~
@1368 = ~It can't be helped, Gavin. We've got things we've got to do, and no one else will do them if we don't.~
@1369 = ~I don't know. It has its appeal.~
@1370 = ~You get up, do whatever work you have to do, come home, kiss your lover, and maybe spend a bit of the evening mending socks or visiting friends.~
@1371 = ~You mend socks?~
@1372 = ~Well, you're lucky, then. Your lover's right here.~
@1373 = ~I can kiss my lover anytime I want.~
@1374 = ~So how is that different from our lives? Except for the 'going home' part, that's pretty much how we live our lives.~
@1375 = ~I like to be different.~
@1376 = ~And you are, but that isn't the point.~
@1377 = ~Well, that isn't really the point.~
@1378 = ~And I'm glad you are, but that isn't the point.~
@1379 = ~Figuratively speaking.~
@1380 = ~My point is that you don't spend the evening slogging through rat-infested dungeons. There were times, back in the old days, when I could go for weeks on end without ever seeing a rat, let alone a troll.~
@1381 = ~Those days are gone forever, Gavin. You might as well get used to it.~
@1382 = ~What? You don't like cold, dark corridors festooned with cobwebs?~
@1383 = ~There are times when I miss that, too, but what can we do? Give up and go home?~
@1384 = ~But it has its good points. There's the treasure, for one.~
@1385 = ~Especially not the cobwebs.~
@1386 = ~Alright, maybe we have to give up the idea of keeping normal hours, but can't we find some balance between what's personal and what's important?~
@1387 = ~Of course we can. We can hold hands whenever we aren't actually in combat.~
@1388 = ~Of course we can. I'll just hold hands with my lover whenever we aren't actually in combat.~
@1389 = ~Maybe we can. We can't just run away leaving everything unfinished, but maybe we can take some time off, go away for a while.~
@1390 = ~Normal is boring. I want no part of it.~
@1391 = ~We can't think about 'personal' at all right now. There are too many lives depending on our decisions.~
@1392 = ~I think you're missing the point.~
@1393 = ~No, Gavin, I think you are. We've got a job to do, and we won't get any rest until it's done.~
@1394 = ~That's pretty blunt.~
@1395 = ~Maybe we could get away for a little while.~
@1396 = ~I think I know how to take your mind off things.~
@1397 = ~You just need to get laid.~
@1398 = ~Sorry, I didn't intend offense. I know we've got a job to do. I just think we need some time to relax, too.~
@1399 = ~We just haven't got time to relax. People are counting on us.~
@1400 = ~I think I just swallowed my tongue.~
@1401 = ~With comments like that, you just did.~
@1402 = ~Well, that just got my undivided attention.~
@1403 = ~It might work for a little while, but the worries always come back.~
@1404 = ~You're right. It isn't time to rest yet, but maybe we can go away for a bit, camp out for one night someplace remote and relatively peaceful.~
@1405 = ~We're in the middle of the woods, Gavin. We'll be camping tonight whether you like it or not.~
@1406 = ~We're in the middle of something now, but we'll go camping next chance we get.~
@1407 = ~I can't make any promises.~
@1408 = ~We'll go where I say we go, understood?~
@1409 = ~I think I'll like that.~
@1410 = ~I'm complaining again, aren't I?~
@1411 = ~Maybe, but you have a reason.~
@1412 = ~No more than usual.~
@1413 = ~No, I understand your point.~
@1414 = ~It's for your sake as well as mine. Spending a day or two in the wilds would do you good. You'll feel better after a restful night under the stars.~
@1415 = ~Do you remember Beregost?~ [bgav116]
@1416 = ~Remember it? I only hope that one day I'll live to forget it!~
@1417 = ~It was the biggest town I had ever seen! Well, until I came to Baldur's Gate.~
@1418 = ~It was there that I met you. I'm not likely to forget it.~
@1419 = ~Only vaguely. I only passed through it a couple of times.~
@1420 = ~Not really. The past runs together, after a while, and it no longer seems so important.~
@1421 = ~I don't remember it as being that unpleasant.~
@1422 = ~It was a small town with muddy streets and bad ale.~
@1423 = ~I don't like any city, really.~
@1424 = ~It wasn't unpleasant, really, just small.~
@1425 = ~We weren't in the city half a day before we got into our first fight. And then there was Marl. Why couldn't he have just left me alone?~
@1426 = ~I was joking, Gavin. I met you there, so I'm bound to remember it.~
@1427 = ~The whole world seemed a lot smaller then. We had fewer cares.~
@1428 = ~'We?' You weren't there.~
@1429 = ~It sure didn't seem that way at the time.~
@1430 = ~Do you think so? I remember being a lot more anxious then than I am now.~
@1431 = ~I'm surprised to hear you speak of the place and the time so fondly, considering the life that you were running from.~
@1432 = ~Nostalgia, Gavin?~
@1433 = ~Ah, but will you remember it well or ill for the association?~
@1434 = ~That all depends on how vexed I am with you at the moment.~
@1435 = ~I thought you the most awkward-looking creature I had ever set eyes on.~
@1436 = ~You were different then, more hesitant and insecure.~
@1437 = ~I remember you tripping over the rut of a wagon wheel and knocking me into a mud puddle, if that's what you mean.~
@1438 = ~Well, I think. You've always been a good friend.~
@1439 = ~Beregost will always be dear to me for that.~
@1440 = ~Are you sure you want to know?~
@1441 = ~I remember it better, but I lived there for sixteen years, if you count the time before my ordination.~
@1442 = ~(yawn) Is this going to be a long story?~
@1443 = ~Well, I met you there, but that's about all I really remember about it.~
@1444 = ~So what did I miss?~
@1445 = ~Is there a reason you're thinking about this now?~
@1446 = ~I know what you mean.~
@1447 = ~Bad ale? The Red Sheaf had the best ale on the Sword Coast!~
@1448 = ~That's right, you did like that place, didn't you?~
@1449 = ~This isn't about ale, though, is it?~
@1450 = ~It was swill, Gavin. You were probably just too drunk to remember it clearly.~
@1451 = ~About all I remember about the Red Sheaf was the dwarf that tried to kill me.~
@1452 = ~No, you don't, do you? But it isn't really about Beregost.~
@1453 = ~Poor Marl. The death of his son hit him hard. He was never what you'd call cheerful. He could find the thundercloud behind any rainbow, but after his son died he gave up on life completely. I know the townspeople blamed you for his death, but I think he was just looking for a way to die.~
@1454 = ~But what else do you remember about the place?~
@1455 = ~I met you there.~
@1456 = ~Not much, really. I was only passing through.~
@1457 = ~Apart from muddy streets and bad ale?~
@1458 = ~Garrick. He was such a sweet, silly boy, with his heart in his hand and his brain in his -~
@1459 = ~Garrick. He was a character, all right, with his heart in his hand and his brain in his -~
@1460 = ~I remember you kissing some prostitutes outside Feldpost's.~
@1461 = ~How much else could there be to remember? The town wasn't very big.~
@1462 = ~But I was, though you didn't know it. I lived there for seven years before I became a Dawnbringer and nine years after. It was time enough for me to get to know the place. But what do you remember about it?~
@1463 = ~Garrick. He was character, all right, with his heart in his hand and his brain in his -~
@1464 = ~It never does. You're stronger now than you were then, so it takes more to make you anxious.~
@1465 = ~If you're saying that someday I'm going to look back on the present as a time of idyllic bliss, I don't want to think about it.~
@1466 = ~When does it end, Gavin? When do we get to look back on the past and think how much better things are now?~
@1467 = ~Actually, I meant that I'm all right. I don't feel the pressure that I used to.~
@1468 = ~That just goes to show that a person can get used to anything.~
@1469 = ~Even you.~
@1470 = ~I would rather not have had to learn that lesson.~
@1471 = ~Or maybe I've just stopped caring.~
@1472 = ~Stress is like pain. Something can only hurt so much before you become numb.~
@1473 = ~How are you holding up?~
@1474 = ~I wasn't running from anything... maybe I was. I wanted a second chance, an opportunity to leave the past behind and forge ahead with people who knew nothing of me or my problems. Needless to say, that didn't work. I could never abandon Lanie, in any case, but the lie of my silence got too heavy to bear.~
@1475 = ~And then there was you to think about. I couldn't hide my past from you and I found that I didn't want to try.~
@1476 = ~It feels like a lifetime ago, or like it happened to someone else. When I think about the petty things that used to keep me awake at night with worry... well, these days, I wish that was all we had to worry about.~
@1477 = ~I wouldn't have pegged you for a worrier.~
@1478 = ~Me, too.~
@1479 = ~You hid your concern well. From your snores, I never would have guessed that anxiety kept you awake.~
@1480 = ~So what keeps you awake now?~
@1481 = ~You worry too much. Things aren't that bad, really.~
@1482 = ~I'm a trial to you, I know. But that isn't what I was thinking about, at the moment.~
@1483 = ~I'm not surprised. You never think about how much you irritate those around you.~
@1484 = ~All right, what were you thinking about?~
@1485 = ~I was teasing you, Gavin.~
@1486 = ~I hate to say it, but this isn't the best time for a conversation.~
@1487 = ~And now?~
@1488 = ~Some things never change.~
@1489 = ~Oh, you're still a mess, but I wouldn't have it any other way.~
@1490 = ~You're more confident these days, but you'll always be Gavin.~
@1491 = ~As long as you're quick with the healing spells, you can stagger your way from here to Icewind Dale.~
@1492 = ~Why are you so worried about what I think?~
@1493 = ~Now I think you're pretty alright.~
@1494 = ~I love you, Gavin. What more is there to say?~
@1495 = ~Well, I do value your opinion.~
@1496 = ~You're fine the way you are.~
@1497 = ~I love you just the way you are.~
@1498 = ~I've learned to expect very little.~
@1499 = ~We all have our faults.~
@1500 = ~I need you to think less about my opinion and more about your responsibilities in this party.~
@1501 = ~Just my luck you'd have such a good memory. Regardless, that wasn't what I wanted to talk to you about.~
@1502 = ~It warms my heart to hear you say that, but that wasn't what I wanted to talk to you about.~
@1503 = ~I thank you, but that wasn't what I wanted to talk to you about.~
@1504 = ~Wonderful. But that wasn't what I wanted to talk to you about.~
@1505 = ~You're still as charming as always... but that wasn't what I wanted to talk to you about.~
@1506 = ~Nothing, really. Nothing happens in Beregost. That's part of its charm. But that wasn't what I wanted to talk to you about.~
@1507 = ~I've been thinking a lot about the past lately.~
@1508 = ~You? I thought Lathandrites lived for 'tomorrow,' not 'yesterday.'~
@1509 = ~And what conclusion have you reached?~
@1510 = ~I'd like you to think more about the present, especially where it concerns your doing your job in this party.~
@1511 = ~And you said this wouldn't be a long story.~
@1512 = ~I have, too. I'm looking for answers, but they're hard to find.~
@1513 = ~I did. It was almost like a second home... or a first home, after Miranda and I fell out. But that wasn't what I wanted to talk to you about.~
@1514 = ~Perhaps... The Red Sheaf was almost like a second home... or a first home, after Miranda and I fell out. But that wasn't what I wanted to talk to you about.~
@1515 = ~One does tend to remember assassins... though you seem to have had more than your share of those. But that wasn't what I wanted to talk to you about.~
@1516 = ~Ahem... er.. yes, I believe I remember him. But that wasn't what I wanted to talk to you about.~
@1517 = ~True. I don't see how it could get much worse... though I hope that doesn't mean that I simply lack imagination. But that isn't what I wanted to talk to you about.~
@1518 = ~It was only one prostitue, she kissed me, and she did it because I treated her like a human being instead of a trade item. But that isn't what I wanted to talk to you about.~
@1519 = ~Soon, I hope. But that isn't what I wanted to talk to you about.~
@1520 = ~So, you're used to me, eh? Be careful. That's one step shy of abhorrence. But that wasn't what I wanted to talk to you about.~
@1521 = ~After everything you have been through, do you still think you get to choose your lessons? But never mind. I had nothing so profound on my mind today, though I did wish to speak with you.~
@1522 = ~Do you really mean that?~
@1523 = ~No, not really. Sometimes, I wish I did, though.~
@1524 = ~Yes, unfortunately. It's too much, Gavin. Too many people expect me to solve their problems for them.~
@1525 = ~I don't know what to think, anymore. If I help this person, then that person must suffer. Too many choices.~
@1526 = ~I don't want to talk about it. What were you going to say?~
@1527 = ~You can't say something like that and expect me to let it drop.~
@1528 = ~Look, I said I don't want to talk about it and I meant it.~
@1529 = ~I was exaggerating, all right?~
@1530 = ~I'm tired, Gavin. I've been fighting the good fight all this time, and I'm weary.~
@1531 = ~Think about it. We slave away, risking our lives time and again, and for what? The chance at a shallow, unmarked grave? I'm done with being the hero.~
@1532 = ~Me? My faith keeps me going, so I'll be fine.~
@1533 = ~Enough about me, though. There was something I wanted to talk to you about.~
@1534 = ~Usually, I'm not, but you face troubles that most people don't, and I can't help but be concerned. But that wasn't what I wanted to talk to you about, at least this time.~
@1535 = ~There are times... and you face troubles that most people don't, so I can't help but be concerned. But that wasn't what I wanted to talk to you about, at least this time.~
@1536 = ~I am, where you're concerned. You face troubles that most people don't, and I worry that you'll be alright. But that wasn't what I wanted to talk to you about, at least this time.~
@1537 = ~Perhaps I did. Never mind that, though.~
@1538 = ~Never mind about that, for the time being.~
@1539 = ~You, if I'm lucky, but never mind about that, for the time being.~
@1540 = ~Would you like me to go?~
@1541 = ~No, you do have your uses.~
@1542 = ~If I ever make up my mind, you'll be the first to know.~
@1543 = ~Perish the thought!~
@1544 = ~It might be for the best.~
@1545 = ~Never mind, then.~
@1546 = ~It isn't as if I could be someone else if I tried.~
@1547 = ~I was remembering life before any of this, when the worst thing that I could expect at the end of any given day was to come home and find that Miranda had taken off again or that the crows had raided the garden.~
@1548 = ~Every morning, I'd go to the temple before dawn, celebrate the sunrise, then go do whatever work I had to do that day. At the end of it, if all was well at home, I'd put Lanie on my knee and we'd build castles out of twigs or tell each other stories until it was time for her to go to bed.~
@1549 = ~Sometimes, if Miranda was in for the night, I'd head over to the Red Sheaf for a quiet pint and a bit of gossip.~
@1550 = ~I never realized how much I would miss those days.~
@1551 = ~I'd have been bored out of my skull.~
@1552 = ~You could go back, you know. You'd be safe enough in Athkatla, if I wasn't there. Once Lanie was done with her studies, you could go back to Beregost and everything would be as it was.~
@1553 = ~I wouldn't mind that kind of a life, myself.~
@1554 = ~Could you go back, though? After everything we have seen and done, would you be content with a life like that?~
@1555 = ~I'm not about to leave with your quest still undone.~
@1556 = ~I wouldn't abandon you. Not now, with your quest still undone.~
@1557 = ~I wouldn't abandon you. Not now, not ever.~
@1558 = ~Do you think I am neglecting my duties?~
@1559 = ~I think you're spending too much time flirting with me and not enough time doing whatever it is clerics do.~
@1560 = ~I think you're spending too much time flirting with me and not enough time doing... whatever else you're supposed to be doing.~
@1561 = ~Let's just say that you're easily distracted.~
@1562 = ~You're pulling your weight. That's all I ask.~
@1563 = ~No, you're fine. I just don't want you to get side-tracked.~
@1564 = ~Not at all! I appreciate your diligence. It's only that we all need to be careful and remain focused in order to survive.~
@1565 = ~Very true.~
@1566 = ~I can understand that. If you didn't care about others, your life would be easier... and less dangerous. But you do care about others, thank the gods. Anyway...~
@1567 = ~Think about what you're saying, <CHARNAME>! Have you become so weary that you have given yourself over to evil?~
@1568 = ~Maybe I just need a rest.~
@1569 = ~No... I guess not.~
@1570 = ~I'm not exactly known for my good works.~
@1571 = ~You make it sound like taking a little time for myself is akin to slaughtering a village.~
@1572 = ~True, but I thought we were working on that.~
@1573 = ~Give it up, Gavin. Nothing you say is ever going to change me.~
@1574 = ~We are, Gavin. I just need more time.~
@1575 = ~I'm waiting for inspiration.~
@1576 = ~Unfortunate. I pray that you find the way to the light, but I know I cannot force you.~
@1577 = ~Then time you shall have. As Lathander gives me strength, I will help you as long as hope remains.~
@1578 = ~I pray that you may find it... and soon.~
@1579 = ~I know, <CHARNAME>, I know. Everyone expects so much from you, it's no wonder you're feeling the strain. I wish there was something I could do to help.~
@1580 = ~But you've been through enough for one day. How about I carry your pack for a while and we stop soon? You can use some rest.~
@1581 = ~That sounds like a good idea.~
@1582 = ~Do I look like some weakling, unable to carry my own pack?~
@1583 = ~No, Gavin, I'm all right.~
@1584 = ~No, of course not. Just don't push yourself too hard.~
@1585 = ~Fine.~
@1586 = ~All right then. But don't be afraid to call a halt if you change your mind.~
@1587 = ~If you're serious, you and I have nothing further to say to each other.~
@1588 = ~No, Gavin, wait! I didn't mean it like that. I'm tired, that's all.~
@1589 = ~Hmf. Well, that's something, I guess.~
@1590 = ~I... I'm surprised to hear you say that.~
@1591 = ~Hopefully, at least some of those involve making you happy.~
@1592 = ~And we all know what those are.~
@1593 = ~Sometimes, I don't know what to make of you, <CHARNAME>.~
@1594 = ~Well, that's certainly a relief!~
@1595 = ~I'm sorry you feel that way. Farewell.~
@1596 = ~Everyone is different. I found that life fulfilling.~
@1597 = ~But if you had that kind of a life, would you like it?~
@1598 = ~That's the question I've been asking myself.~
@1599 = ~It won't happen again.~
@1600 = ~I'll work on it.~
@1601 = ~I take the hint. Back to work.~
@1602 = ~I won't let you down.~
@1603 = ~That life might well be closed forever to us, now, anyhow. I could live that life because I knew no other. Perhaps it was the same with you, in Candlekeep. But now, we've seen more of the world. How small would Beregost seem now, and how confining?~
@1604 = ~It was too small and too dull then, so I can only imagine it would be doubly so now.~
@1605 = ~I don't know. Maybe one day, we'll have a chance to find out.~
@1606 = ~We'll figure that out if we survive.~
@1607 = ~That does it. I need to find more for you to do so you don't start thinking about things like this anymore.~
@1608 = ~Heh. Maybe I am thinking too much. Never mind.~
@1609 = ~I'm sure that's all that's wrong. Maybe we can afford a day or two of rest, to let you recover some of your enthusiasm.~
@1610 = ~Well, that's a relief. But you've had a long <DAYNIGHT>, and the sooner we get moving, the sooner you'll be able to rest.~
@1611 = ~Everyone needs rest, <CHARNAME>, and I'm not saying that you don't, but there's a difference between taking a day or two off and abandoning the innocent to death and torture. Rest, if you need it, but don't give up. Please.~
@1612 = ~All right, then. Give me your pack, and just a little further, now.~
@1613 = ~I guess we will. But I've bent your ear long enough for one <DAYNIGHT>. Let's move on.~
@1614 = ~Probably. But I've bent your ear long enough for one <DAYNIGHT>. Let's move on.~
@1615 = ~It's no use. I've just read this journal entry four times, and I still don't remember what in the nine hells I just read.~ [bgav117]
@1616 = ~Maybe you're too tired?~
@1617 = ~Are you still hungry?~
@1618 = ~Are you warm enough?~
@1619 = ~Do you have a headache?~
@1620 = ~So put the scroll down and go do something else.~
@1621 = ~No, I'm wide awake.~
@1622 = ~No, I had enough dinner.~
@1623 = ~No, I'm warm enough.~
@1624 = ~No, I feel fine.~
@1625 = ~No, I need to read it.~
@1626 = ~I just can't seem to concentrate.~
@1627 = ~Want to take a walk? Maybe getting away from it for a moment or two will help.~
@1628 = ~We all have days like that. There isn't much you can do about it.~
@1629 = ~I think I need to get up and move around a bit. Would you like to join me?~
@1630 = ~Sure.~
@1631 = ~No, thanks.~
@1632 = ~Ah well. I'll be back later.~
@1633 = ~(You walk some distance away from the others, just out of earshot, though you could still see the camp, if the undergrowth were not so heavy.)~
@1634 = ~(You walk out of the inn and into the city streets, no clear route in mind.)~
@1635 = ~This glade looks private enough.~
@1636 = ~This alley looks private enough.~
@1637 = ~I just don't know what's wrong with me. I haven't been able to concentrate on much of anything all day.~
@1638 = ~Is something bothering you?~
@1639 = ~Everybody gets like that sometimes. It's nothing to worry about.~
@1640 = ~You'd better pull yourself together, Gavin. I need everyone to be at their best.~
@1641 = ~Are you able to fulfil your duties to the group?~
@1642 = ~Buck up, Gavin. I don't tolerate slackers.~
@1643 = ~Nothing ails me, but I'm useless, and that has me concerned.~
@1644 = ~I'm not worried, but I am concerned.~
@1645 = ~I know, and that's why this is so irritating.~
@1646 = ~I can still pray, so I'm getting my spells, but that's about all I'm good for.~
@1647 = ~I'm fine. There's nothing wrong with me, but I can't seem to focus on anything. I can't even read our journal and remember what it said.~
@1648 = ~Good thing it isn't your job to remember it.~
@1649 = ~You just need sleep. You've been run ragged over the last few days.~
@1650 = ~Don't be too hard on yourself. You don't need to remember everything.~
@1651 = ~You've got one night to get your act together. If you don't snap out of it by morning, we're going to have words.~
@1652 = ~That's besides the point.~
@1653 = ~You could say the same for any of us, but I don't see you staring at the lantern without a clear thought in your head.~
@1654 = ~I never would, but I'd like to remember something, at least.~
@1655 = ~So, no pressure, then.~
@1656 = ~I need to find some way to restore my concentration, or I'm as good as useless to you, and that's not a position I want to be in.~
@1657 = ~Why don't you give your mind a rest for now. Sketch or something. You'll be better after some relaxation.~
@1658 = ~Have you tried meditation?~
@1659 = ~Just don't think about it. The more you worry, the harder it will be to concentrate.~
@1660 = ~When was the last time you were with a woman?~
@1661 = ~Maybe you need some loving.~
@1662 = ~Maybe you need to be with a woman.~
@1663 = ~Maybe you need some physical gratification.~
@1664 = ~Your problems are your own. Deal with them.~
@1665 = ~What? For old times' sake?~
@1666 = ~Why not?~
@1667 = ~Not me! Someone else.~
@1668 = ~Right. Forget I said anything.~
@1669 = ~No, that isn't what I want.~
@1670 = ~Wouldn't it feel strange, with things as they stand between us?~
@1671 = ~How badly do you want it?~
@1672 = ~I miss the lovemaking, to be honest. I don't miss the commitment, or your moodiness, or your snoring, but the sex was all right.~
@1673 = ~I've been meaning to talk to you about that. I miss you, Gavin.~
@1674 = ~Hmm. Yes, it probably would feel strange.~
@1675 = ~I miss you, too. Do you want to try again? We could pick up right where we left off.~
@1676 = ~I'd like that.~
@1677 = ~How about if we went back to sleeping together, but left out the commitment.~
@1678 = ~Maybe it would be better if we left things as they are.~
@1679 = ~Are you sure that's what you want? I'll do it if I have to, but you have to understand that if there's another misunderstanding between us, or even if you send me away, that's it. Over and done with forever.~
@1680 = ~I can live with that.~
@1681 = ~If that's the way you want it, fine.~
@1682 = ~Since you do enjoy the physical aspects of our relationship so much, I seem to have some rather pressing needs, at the moment...~
@1683 = ~We'll just have to see what we can do about that, won't we?~
@1684 = ~I'm sorry, but I'm not really in the mood tonight.~
@1685 = ~Badly enough that I'm having this conversation.~
@1686 = ~Come on, then. You know what to do.~
@1687 = ~How does it feel to want something you can't have?~
@1688 = ~I'm sorry, Gavin. Our separation must be very hard on you.~
@1689 = ~You have no idea.~
@1690 = ~You know, there are times that I'm sorry we aren't together any more. This isn't one of them.~
@1691 = ~I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that!~
@1692 = ~Let's make love.~
@1693 = ~I'm glad some good has come out of our walk.~
@1694 = ~This doesn't mean I want to sleep with you right now, however.~
@1695 = ~So... now that we're back together again, some needs do seem a bit pressing...~
@1696 = ~I'm sorry, love. I'm not really in the mood tonight. Will you be alright?~
@1697 = ~I'm glad we had this chance to talk. We're wasting our time here. Let's just go back.~
@1698 = ~Now that you mention it, love, the need really does seem a bit pressing.~
@1699 = ~It won't be easy forgoing the pleasure of your embrace, but I'll live.~
@1700 = ~Now that we've identified the problem, though, it's probably best if we get back.~
@1701 = ~Perhaps I do.~
@1702 = ~I don't know. I'm not really in the mood tonight. A little frustration never hurt anyone.~
@1703 = ~That's going to present a problem. We're completely unprepared.~
@1704 = ~There's more than one way to satisfy you, Gavin.~
@1705 = ~Let your leggings down, and I'll see what I can do for you.~
@1706 = ~Then we'll just have to wait until we get back and the others are asleep. With more privacy, we'll have more options.~
@1707 = ~Then you'll just have to do without.~
@1708 = ~That is unfortunate. Will you be alright if you have to do without?~
@1709 = ~You mean right here?~
@1710 = ~Why not? We seem to be alone.~
@1711 = ~No, when we get back. Or don't you think you can wait that long?~
@1712 = ~No, when we get back. Unless the risk of discovery excites you.~
@1713 = ~Hmm. Do I give Gavin what he wants, or do I make him wait? Decisions, decisions.~
@1714 = ~On second thought, this doesn't seem like such a good idea.~
@1715 = ~You are such a tease!~
@1716 = ~I think you'll get your wish.~
@1717 = ~Wait, I think, but just until the others are asleep.~
@1718 = ~Such impatience! For that, my dear, you'll have to wait.~
@1719 = ~Very well, my darling. I'll come to you when the others are asleep.~
@1720 = ~(sigh) Well, at least now I know why I feel so distracted.~
@1721 = ~Well, I did go nine years without any relief, so I can probably wait until the others are asleep.~
@1722 = ~You don't sound so sure about that.~
@1723 = ~Since we've identified the problem, do you want to go back now?~
@1724 = ~You're going to have to wait a bit longer than that. I'm not in the mood.~
@1725 = ~Very much. Let's go.~
@1726 = ~Let's just say that the suggestion has really piqued my interest.~
@1727 = ~We don't want you to be unhappy, now, do we?~
@1728 = ~Then let's go back now and start acting sleepy.~
@1729 = ~Poor Gavin. You are really out of luck tonight, because I'm just not in the mood.~
@1730 = ~Let's make ourselves comfortable, then!~
@1731 = ~Let's.~
@1732 = ~Hmm. Maybe it would be better if we waited until later.~
@1733 = ~(Your world condenses until it contains only you, Gavin, and the pleasure you find in each other's embrace.)~
@1734 = ~If you don't mind being on top, I can sit on that log over there.~
@1735 = ~Sounds good.~
@1736 = ~I don't know. We're a little too exposed for that. Just let your leggings down and I'll see what I can do for you.~
@1737 = ~If you don't mind being on top, I can sit on that crate over there.~
@1738 = ~(He waits for you to settle yourself on his lap, then kisses you passionately. His hands move over your breasts, then around to your back and down to your hips. He pulls you forward until you feel yourself pressing against the bulge in his leggings.)~
@1739 = ~(You rock back and forth with him, grinding yourself against him.)~
@1740 = ~We need to get rid of some of this clothing.~
@1741 = ~You are excited now, aren't you. Too bad you aren't getting any tonight.~
@1742 = ~I'm having second thoughts about this. We don't have a lot of privacy.~
@1743 = ~Should we loosen some of this clothing?~
@1744 = ~Definitely.~
@1745 = ~No, I think we should leave the clothing on.~
@1746 = ~Maybe we'd better just go back.~
@1747 = ~(He leans back so you can rub yourself against him.)~
@1748 = ~(You reposition yourself to bring your groin in closer contact with his and begin moving with him.)~
@1749 = ~(You concentrate on pleasing yourself, moving in whatever way brings you the most satisfaction.)~
@1750 = ~(If Gavin is disappointed by your decision to have a less intimate encounter, he gives no sign. His eyes quickly close, and his grip on your hips tightens.~
@1751 = ~(He arches his back, and his breathing changes, deepening and becoming more ragged.)~
@1752 = ~(You continue moving against him until you are satisfied.)~
@1753 = ~Easy, Gavin, we don't want you finishing too soon, do we?~
@1754 = ~We need to stop right now.~
@1755 = ~(At first, Gavin seems disappointed that you decided on a less intimate encounter. His expression borders on boredom, rather than desire, but after a few moments, his eyes close and his grip on your hips tightens.~
@1756 = ~(You surrender to your own pleasure, and then get up off of him.)~
@1757 = ~Not a lot of choices... what rubs you rubs me. Ohno...~
@1758 = ~(Finally, with one last thrust upwards and a convulsive shudder, he is done. He puts his arms around your back again, pulls you close, and buries his face in your hair.)~
@1759 = ~You look like you needed that.~
@1760 = ~Ow, think you might have been a bit too rough, towards the end.~
@1761 = ~I think we might have a real mess on our hands.~
@1762 = ~Think you'll be able to concentrate now?~
@1763 = ~I hope this doesn't mean you won't be able to rise to the occasion later.~
@1764 = ~My appetite for you is insatiable.~
@1765 = ~Well, love, much as I hate to curtail our private time together, this is no place for basking in the afterglow. Why don't we get back, and I'll gladly hold you all night long.~
@1766 = ~(He helps you to the ground, then hurriedly drops his leggings and sits down again. From the looks of things, he's more than ready for anything you might have in mind.)~
@1767 = ~(You adjust your own attire to expose your lower half and sit facing him.)~
@1768 = ~(You begin to walk away from him.)~
@1769 = ~Well, isn't that a pretty picture.~
@1770 = ~You really will do anything for a lay, won't you? Well, too bad, because you aren't getting one.~
@1771 = ~Gavin, I'm having second thoughts about this. What if someone comes? I think we should stop.~
@1772 = ~Er... <CHARNAME>? Are you going to leave me here like this?~
@1773 = ~I was thinking about it, but I've changed my mind.~
@1774 = ~Maybe I'll just watch you handle this yourself.~
@1775 = ~Would you mind if I watched you please yourself?~
@1776 = ~Yes, actually, I am.~
@1777 = ~No, but I'm having second thoughts. I don't think we should be doing this.~
@1778 = ~You're going to need to lose a bit of clothing, then.~
@1779 = ~(You make the necessary adjustments and sit facing him.)~
@1780 = ~On second thought, maybe it would be better if we just went back.~
@1781 = ~(Once you are positioned over him, he kisses you again, once more sliding his hands down your back. He pulls you down and toward his body, thrusting his own hips forward to take you. He gasps as he penetrates you, then moves his hands back to your breasts to caress you while you ride him.)~
@1782 = ~(You push yourself further down onto him, sliding your hips back and forth to increase the friction.)~
@1783 = ~(You let him do as he will.)~
@1784 = ~Easy, Gavin! Not so deep!~
@1785 = ~That's enough. Just a taste, for now.~
@1786 = ~(sigh) Your tantalizing ways can really be  nuisance, you know.~
@1787 = ~(He pulls you down and toward his body, thrusting his own hips forward to take you. He gasps as he penetrates you, then moves his hands back to your breasts to caress you while you ride him.)~
@1788 = ~Sorry! Got carriedaway.~
@1789 = ~You'd better slow down, <CHARNAME>. I'm worked up enough already.~
@1790 = ~(You slow your movements, raising yourself almost off him before falling back onto him again.)~
@1791 = ~(You maintain your pace, rocking yourself against his body.)~
@1792 = ~(If anything, you increase the tempo, gripping his hips tightly with your thighs.)~
@1793 = ~Then we'd better save it for later. I don't want to spoil the fun now.~
@1794 = ~(He moves his hands down to your waist again, helping to support you as you move over him. At first, he meets every descending movement with a slight thrust, but he soon stops, obviously wanting to prolong your pleasure.)~
@1795 = ~(Soon, the intensity of his movements increases, however, and he pulls you down onto him with greater force. His breathing has grown ragged, and punctuated by sudden gulps of air.)~
@1796 = ~I can't take much more, <CHARNAME>.~
@1797 = ~Oh no! I'm nowhere near ready yet!~
@1798 = ~Then let it go. You need this.~
@1799 = ~Then let's stop this right here.~
@1800 = ~Then you'd better stop moving around so much. Here.~
@1801 = ~(He guides you until he is as deep inside you as he can be, then begins to caress the center of your pleasure with the fingertips of one hand, but not moving in any other way.)~
@1802 = ~(You surrender to the pleasure.)~
@1803 = ~(Despite his warning that you should move less, you continue to writhe on his lap.)~
@1804 = ~No, Gavin, don't. You need this more than I do.~
@1805 = ~(Once he feels the last waves of your release subside, he begins moving again, thrusting deep into you.)~
@1806 = ~(You let him go on until he is satisfied.)~
@1807 = ~What, you aren't done yet?~
@1808 = ~Are you almost there?~
@1809 = ~Well, that was pleasant, but we should get back.~
@1810 = ~Gavin! Stop this right now!~
@1811 = ~Almost...~
@1812 = ~Well, you'd better hurry up. We need to get back.~
@1813 = ~Can you hurry it up a little? I don't know how long the others will wait before they come looking for us.~
@1814 = ~(You increase the intensity of your own movements.)~
@1815 = ~(You reposition your legs so that you can get up off of him.)~
@1816 = ~(You leap away from him.) Oh no you don't!~
@1817 = ~Oh gods... why? Why, <CHARNAME>? I was so close!~
@1818 = ~I need you to save it for later.~
@1819 = ~You get your satisfaction when I say you can, or did you forget?~
@1820 = ~I was done with you. There was no need to make a mess.~
@1821 = ~It will be that much better for you, next time we meet privately.~
@1822 = ~(sigh) I would have enjoyed it now just as much...~
@1823 = ~I... I remember.~
@1824 = ~You're a cruel woman, to get me this far and stop!~
@1825 = ~Ohno! Too late!~
@1826 = ~(His hands hold your hips firmly, and you can sense that for him, it really is too late to stop now.)~
@1827 = ~(Finally, with one last plunge and a convulsive shudder, he is done. He puts his arms around your back again, pulls you close, and buries his face in your hair.)~
@1828 = ~Ow, think you might have gone a little too deep on that one.~
@1829 = ~After that one, it's going to be a while. Hours, at least, maybe even a couple of days.~
@1830 = ~I expect so... though once my blood cools a bit, I'll probably grow sleepy and lethargic.~
@1831 = ~It all comes out in the wash.~
@1832 = ~Sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you.~
@1833 = ~Very, very much. I can't tell you how much better I feel now.~
@1834 = ~This is new! What did you have in mind?~
@1835 = ~Just drop your leggings and you'll find out.~
@1836 = ~You've pleased me with your tongue before. Maybe it's time I returned the favor.~
@1837 = ~You'd like a brisk rubdown, wouldn't you?~
@1838 = ~On second thought, a little frustration never hurt anyone.~
@1839 = ~If you're willing, most definitely.~
@1840 = ~(He loosens his leggings and lowers them, exposing himself to you. The suggestion alone seems to have been enough to arouse him somewhat.)~
@1841 = ~(You stroke him gently.)~
@1842 = ~(You take him into your mouth.)~
@1843 = ~(You seize him and yank him roughly.)~
@1844 = ~I know you can do better than that.~
@1845 = ~You really will do anything for relief, won't you? Pull them back up. You're going to bed frustrated tonight.~
@1846 = ~On second thought, it wouldn't hurt you to go to bed frustrated, once in a while.~
@1847 = ~(If his excitement was less than complete when you began, the feel of your lips soon brings him to full arousal.)~
@1848 = ~Easy, woman! You'll do me an injury!~
@1849 = ~(You run your hands over him more gently.)~
@1850 = ~(You continue to stroke him vigorously.)~
@1851 = ~You want gentle, talk to Aerie.~
@1852 = ~You want gentle, talk to Imoen.~
@1853 = ~Show me how I should do it, then.~
@1854 = ~(Before long, Gavin's attention is completely fixed on what you are doing. Any trace of softness is completely gone from him, and his face takes on a look of intense concentration.)~
@1855 = ~(You begin to stroke him more violently.)~
@1856 = ~(You continue, though you increase the pace a little.)~
@1857 = ~(You close your mouth around him.)~
@1858 = ~Alright, I think you're excited enough. I'll stop now.~
@1859 = ~Oh gods... feels too good... too good...~
@1860 = ~(You slide your mouth around him, applying more pressure with your lips.)~
@1861 = ~(You ease up slightly, flicking your tongue over him.)~
@1862 = ~(You wrap your fingers around the base, increasing the friction.)~
@1863 = ~I think you've had enough for one day.~
@1864 = ~Can you... can you take it in your mouth again? So close...~
@1865 = ~(You comply with his request.)~
@1866 = ~It's too much. I can't.~
@1867 = ~(You wrap your fingers around him and begin to stroke him.)~
@1868 = ~Do you want to stop? We don't have to do this, you know.~
@1869 = ~No, my jaw just needs a rest.~
@1870 = ~(You go back to what you were doing before.)~
@1871 = ~(You make a half-hearted attempt at it.)~
@1872 = ~Maybe we'd better stop.~
@1873 = ~(Gavin wordlessly takes your hand and places it on his groin, guiding it over the wet skin. After a moment, he lets his hand drop, leaving you to stroke him at will.)~
@1874 = ~(You caress him.)~
@1875 = ~(You make a few half-hearted strokes and then rub your hand on his leggings.)~
@1876 = ~You do it, Gavin. I want to watch.~
@1877 = ~I think we'd better stop.~
@1878 = ~You don't seem to enjoy this, so let's just stop.~
@1879 = ~(He winces and gasps at the violence of your assault on his groin, but his excitement continues to rise. Before long, his protests cease and his face takes on an expression of intense concentration.)~
@1880 = ~(You continue to rub him even harder than before.)~
@1881 = ~(You ease the pressure somewhat and begin to stroke him more gently.)~
@1882 = ~I think that's about enough for now. If we keep this up, you'll spend yourself, and then you won't be any fun later.~
@1883 = ~(He sighs appreciatively and lets his head fall back in silent enjoyment. Before long, however, his breathing changes, coming in gasps and gulps, and his legs and abdomen tense.)~
@1884 = ~(You keep doing what you were doing.)~
@1885 = ~Alright, Gavin, that's enough for you.~
@1886 = ~HELP! HELP! I'm being attacked!~
@1887 = ~Oh gods! No!~
@1888 = ~Wait... there's no one here. We aren't under attack.~
@1889 = ~I know. I wanted to see what you'd do.~
@1890 = ~I thought there was someone there. My mistake.~
@1891 = ~If we were, you'd have never known it, distracted as you were.~
@1892 = ~So you were testing me? Nice.~
@1893 = ~Maybe, but we shouldn't be doing this.~
@1894 = ~Get away from me! I can't believe you'd do something that stupid.~
@1895 = ~Ohno...~
@1896 = ~(Gavin removes your hands, replacing them with one of his own. He slides it down the length of the shaft, then back, bringing himself to full arousal in a few strokes.)~
@1897 = ~Are you going to help me with this?~
@1898 = ~I'd rather watch you do it.~
@1899 = ~(You begin to stroke him.)~
@1900 = ~(You press your lips to him and slide him into your mouth.)~
@1901 = ~No, I think you need to go to bed frustrated tonight.~
@1902 = ~(He casts one dark look your way, but he obeys, stroking himself more and more intently as his excitement mounts. His eyes close and his head falls back.)~
@1903 = ~(He casts an enigmatic smile your way, but he obeys, stroking himself more and more intently as his excitement mounts. His eyes close and his head falls back.)~
@1904 = ~(Soon, his whole body goes rigid, his back arches, and it is done.)~
@1905 = ~(Still panting from the exertion, Gavin fumbles for the leggings that have sliped down around his ankles.)~
@1906 = ~Well, I'll sleep better tonight, at least. I hope you enjoyed it.~
@1907 = ~It was incredibly stimulating, actually.~
@1908 = ~Not bad, but we'll have to practice a bit more later.~
@1909 = ~I've seen better.~
@1910 = ~You're off your form, Gavin. You're usually much better than that.~
@1911 = ~It isn't easy, out in the open like this. Next time, let's try for more privacy.~
@1912 = ~There's no pleasing some people! Good thing I'm so fond of you.~
@1913 = ~There's no pleasing some people, but that can't be helped now. It will be hours before I'm ready to go again.~
@1914 = ~There's no pleasing some people, but that can't be helped now.~
@1915 = ~Good thing my appetite for you is insatiable.~
@1916 = ~You shouldn't have let me spend myself, then. It will be hours before I'm ready to go again.~
@1917 = ~We really have been gone a long time, though. We should go back.~
@1918 = ~Alright, that's enough. We're going back.~
@1919 = ~I'm going to need a little incentive to get the rest of the way there.~
@1920 = ~I've lost interest. You're going to bed frustrated tonight.~
@1921 = ~(sigh) I should be used to it, by now. Come on, let's go back.~
@1922 = ~Alright, then. I'll come to you when the others are asleep.~
@1923 = ~At least we've identified the problem. I just hope the blood cools a bit by the time we get back.~
@1924 = ~Probably, but this isn't the time or the place for that.~
@1925 = ~Maybe, but any chance I had of that is long past.~
@1926 = ~Maybe, but I shouldn't.~
@1927 = ~I'm willing.~
@1928 = ~I tried.~
@1929 = ~Thank you, love, but I'm not.~
@1930 = ~<CHARNAME>, there is nothing I would like more than to make love to you, but as agitated as I am, I'd only disappoint you. Let's save that for a time when I'm a bit calmer. It would be better for both of us. I hope you understand.~
@1931 = ~I don't believe I'm telling you this... but you asked. It was ten years ago, with Miranda.~
@1932 = ~Are you serious? No wonder you can't concentrate! We need to do something about that at once!~
@1933 = ~I didn't think a person could survive that long without some kind of relief.~
@1934 = ~You're overdue, Gavin. It's time for you to show some initiative.~
@1935 = ~You show admirable restraint.~
@1936 = ~Was it an unpleasant experience or something?~
@1937 = ~You mean, just ask a woman to lie with me? I don't know if I could do that.~
@1938 = ~Why not? Regular 'exertion' is part of a healthy lifestyle.~
@1939 = ~Sure you could. Just find some woman and let nature take its course.~
@1940 = ~Does your religion forbid it or something?~
@1941 = ~Our religion doesn't forbid it.~
@1942 = ~You're too reserved for your own good.~
@1943 = ~I'm shy, it's true, but that isn't my only problem.~
@1944 = ~Ten years ago, with Miranda.~
@1945 = ~Are you serious? No wonder you can't concentrate! We need to find you some action!~
@1946 = ~For her, it was.~
@1947 = ~You're making a virtue of necessity.~
@1948 = ~It's possible, though it isn't always pleasant.~
@1949 = ~You should make the effort. Regular 'exertion' is part of a healthy lifestyle.~
@1950 = ~How hard can it be? Just find some woman and let nature take its course.~
@1951 = ~Well, good luck with that.~
@1952 = ~You mean, just find some woman who's willing to lie with me? I don't know if I could do that.~
@1953 = ~Hardly! We're encouraged to 'be fruitful in mind and body,' so I'd almost call it a divine imperative, but women have never really been attracted to me.~
@1954 = ~Sure they have. You were probably just too plagued by self-doubt to notice. We'll just have to find a tavern somewhere that has plenty of women with bad eyesight.~
@1955 = ~Sure they have. You were probably just too plagued by self-doubt to notice. We'll just go back to the tavern and find some woman with bad eyesight.~
@1956 = ~Uglier men than you find company.~
@1957 = ~What about someone you know? Maybe if you explain the situation, she'd be willing.~
@1958 = ~What about me?~
@1959 = ~We can always find you a prostitute, next time we're in town.~
@1960 = ~We can always find you a prostitute. There's bound to be one around here somewhere.~
@1961 = ~Maybe you're just not masculine enough.~
@1962 = ~Maybe what you need is a man.~
@1963 = ~You could always take matters into your own hands.~
@1964 = ~Well, there's her to think about.~
@1965 = ~She'd have to want me, and not a lot of women have... nor any, for that matter.~
@1966 = ~I might have to.~
@1967 = ~No, that doesn't interest me. I know that lots of men prefer being with other men, and others are happy with either gender, but I've just never felt an attraction.~
@1968 = ~Well, there goes whatever was left of my confidence.~
@1969 = ~No, I could never do that. I know they need to earn a living, but I'd rather just give them the money and let them keep their dignity.~
@1970 = ~I couldn't! Not that you aren't desirable! But you're our leader, and... well... it just wouldn't be right.~
@1971 = ~I have needs, Gavin.~
@1972 = ~A good leader has to think of the needs of her followers. It would be for a good cause.~
@1973 = ~In other words, you aren't attracted to me.~
@1974 = ~Well, that's good, because I didn't want to sleep with you, anyway.~
@1975 = ~Hey, I was just trying to help, but if you don't want to, I won't make you.~
@1976 = ~I couldn't! Not that you aren't desirable! Gods know how much you are...~
@1977 = ~But you're our leader, and... well... it just wouldn't be right.~
@1978 = ~No, I am... maybe too much.~
@1979 = ~And I'm attracted to you, too.~
@1980 = ~Really?~
@1981 = ~I had no idea it was that bad. Maybe we'd better go back.~
@1982 = ~I'm sorry to hear that. I can't say I feel the same way about you.~
@1983 = ~<CHARNAME>, I appreciate your willingness to... er... improve morale, but I won't allow you to compromise your virtue in satisfying my desires.~
@1984 = ~You'd be satisfying my desires, too.~
@1985 = ~You wouldn't be compromising my virtue.~
@1986 = ~Well, if that's the way you feel about it, you'll just have to deal with your problem yourself.~
@1987 = ~I'd feel like I was.~
@1988 = ~I appreciate the thought.~
@1989 = ~I don't blame you.~
@1990 = ~No... well... <CHARNAME>, every man is attracted to someone different. Some like tall women, some prefer shorter women, and that's just how it goes. It's nothing against you.~
@1991 = ~Yeah, right.~
@1992 = ~You think I'm ugly.~
@1993 = ~Keep your eyes closed and you'll never know.~
@1994 = ~Fine. If you don't want me, I'm sure there's somebody who does.~
@1995 = ~I understand.~
@1996 = ~Many, I'm sure.~
@1997 = ~I'd know.~
@1998 = ~No, you aren't! I'm a fool for refusing you, but I have to.~
@1999 = ~I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>. I'm an ass, and I know it. Maybe we'd better just go back.~
@2000 = ~<CHARNAME>, I said it's been ten years since I was with a woman. Even then, I had no idea what I was doing.~
@2001 = ~You have no idea how painful it is for me to admit this, but my performance at the time left something to be desired... everything, in fact. When I was done, mere heartbeats later, she swore she'd never let me near her again.~
@2002 = ~You were young! I'm sure your stamina has improved.~
@2003 = ~If she loved you, it wouldn't have mattered.~
@2004 = ~Maybe all you need is practice.~
@2005 = ~That's strange. Are you lacking in some way?~
@2006 = ~Not that I know of. I mean, I don't go around comparing myself to other men, but I don't think my... er... endowments are lacking.~
@2007 = ~Can I see?~
@2008 = ~Maybe it was too much, rather than too little?~
@2009 = ~I wasn't talking about your anatomy. I was talking about your technique. A considerate lover doesn't need to rely on his size to make his partner happy.~
@2010 = ~I wasn't talking about anything physical. If there's no emotional attachment, the best lover in the world wouldn't have been able to please her.~
@2011 = ~I'm lacking there, too, that's for sure. I'd like to be better at it, but I never got the chance to learn.~
@2012 = ~I don't believe we're talkng about this.~
@2013 = ~What? You mean you want to measure me to see how I compare with others you've seen? Sorry, but I'm not about to expose myself so you can observe my dimensions.~
@2014 = ~That wasn't what I meant. You've got a fine physique, and I'd just like a chance to see more of it.~
@2015 = ~Come on, Gavin. It isn't like I've never seen a naked man before.~
@2016 = ~If you don't show me, I'll tell everyone in the group that you've got the smallest, most stunted manhood ever possessed by a human male.~
@2017 = ~(You attempt to catch him off guard and get a feel for yourself.)~
@2018 = ~Oh, no! That wasn't what I meant at all! I'm sorry. I kind of killed the mood, didn't I?~
@2019 = ~I'm afraid so. Come on, I'll walk you back.~
@2020 = ~(You manage to make contact before Gavin reacts, but his flaccid state prevents you from discovering anything more than the fact that he possesses the usual complement of organs and that they are completely unremarkable.)~
@2021 = ~(Gavin seizes your wrist and drags your hand away from his groin.)~
@2022 = ~<CHARNAME>! No!~
@2023 = ~Oh, come on! I just wanted to see for myself.~
@2024 = ~I don't know why you're upset. You've got nothing that any other man hasn't got.~
@2025 = ~What's wrong with a little curiosity?~
@2026 = ~I'm sorry, that was rather rude.~
@2027 = ~A bit, yes.~
@2028 = ~And I already told you that, so there was no need to go for a grope.~
@2029 = ~There is no way in hells that I'm letting you... fondle me... just so you can satisfy your curiosity! I can't believe you'd do something so rude!~
@2030 = ~I'm sure everyone will be delighted to hear how closely you examined my manhood.~
@2031 = ~I'm sure Anomen would be delighted to hear how closely you examined my manhood.~
@2032 = ~Come on. We should get back to the others.~
@2033 = ~Perhaps, but this isn't the time or the place for that kind of display. And that's too personal a part of my body to subject to your scrutiny. I'll pass.~
@2034 = ~And now you're flattering me.~
@2035 = ~I hope so, but I can't say it's likely.~
@2036 = ~I think we need to put it to the test.~
@2037 = ~That isn't the most important part, though. As long as you care about each other, you'll find some way to make her happy, even if you do finish early.~
@2038 = ~They say practice makes perfect.~
@2039 = ~Nobody's perfect.~
@2040 = ~Well, that just about puts an end to any hopes I might have had for taking you as a lover.~
@2041 = ~<CHARNAME>... would you mind if I kissed you?~
@2042 = ~I rather hoped that you would.~
@2043 = ~This is rather sudden.~
@2044 = ~(Smile and put your arms around him.)~
@2045 = ~That isn't going to improve your concentration, you know.~
@2046 = ~Ugh! Gods, no!~
@2047 = ~You're probably right.~
@2048 = ~Aye, but it's about all I've been able to think about since you called a halt.~
@2049 = ~Oh, so that's the reason for your lack of focus, is it? Well, we'll just have to do something about that.~
@2050 = ~I wouldn't mind a kiss.~
@2051 = ~Don't you think my lover would object?~
@2052 = ~I don't know, Gavin. You tend to get carried away.~
@2053 = ~You'd better get over it, because I have absolutely no desire to kiss you!~
@2054 = ~Oh... then perhaps we should get back quickly before I humiliate myself any further.~
@2055 = ~(Gavin embraces you eagerly, though his kiss is hesitant, at first. His lips barely graze yours before he withdraws to take a deep, steadying breath.)~
@2056 = ~I'm... I'm too...~
@2057 = ~Yes, Gavin, I know. Just relax and take it slowly.~
@2058 = ~(You silence whatever he is about to say with a kiss.)~
@2059 = ~You're too shy?~
@2060 = ~Too inexperienced. <CHARNAME>, if this goes any further, I'm just going to make a fool of myself.~
@2061 = ~No you won't. Just relax and enjoy it.~
@2062 = ~We're just kissing, Gavin. Nothing has to happen.~
@2063 = ~Then maybe we'd better stop.~
@2064 = ~It might be for the best. Come on, I'll walk you back to camp.~
@2065 = ~(He kisses you again with greater confidence, caressing your lips with his. His hands tremble on your back, but he just draws you closer until you can feel his heartbeat through his tunic.)~
@2066 = ~(You part his lips with your tongue for an even more intimate caress.)~
@2067 = ~(You let him go on at his own pace.)~
@2068 = ~(You start to pull away.)~
@2069 = ~Easy, Gavin. I think you might be taking this too far.~
@2070 = ~I'm forgetting myself, aren't I?~
@2071 = ~No, I just needed some air. (You kiss him again.)~
@2072 = ~That depends. How far do you want to take this?~
@2073 = ~Maybe a little.~
@2074 = ~I think this is about far enough.~
@2075 = ~(He answers your passion with his own. So intent is he on your touch that his hands cease their stroking and even his body is stilled... except that your close embrace leaves you in no doubt of his arousal.)~
@2076 = ~(You release him long enough to loosen your clothing, and guide his hand to your bare breast.)~
@2077 = ~(You run your hand down his abdomen to stroke him.)~
@2078 = ~(You rub yourself against him.)~
@2079 = ~You seem to be in quite a state, Gavin.~
@2080 = ~Do you want it?~
@2081 = ~Gavin, I think we might be getting carried away.~
@2082 = ~Ahem... this is awkward.~
@2083 = ~Women have it easy. Nobody knows if they're... er... thinking about intimacy. Good luck trying to hide it if you're a man.~
@2084 = ~So, now that I've completely humiliated myself, you probably think I'm some kind of pervert.~
@2085 = ~(Gavin gasps at the touch of your bare skin against his palm and starts to withdraw his hand.)~
@2086 = ~No, Gavin, it's alright. I want you to touch me.~
@2087 = ~(You touch his hand, resisting his attempt to remove it.~
@2088 = ~Don't you want to touch?~
@2089 = ~Is something wrong?~
@2090 = ~Maybe it's better if we stop here.~
@2091 = ~I want to, all right, maybe too much.~
@2092 = ~Then just keep doing what you were doing.~
@2093 = ~I want it, too. That can't be wrong, can it?~
@2094 = ~I can tell. It's rather obvious.~
@2095 = ~And that's just the way I want it. Hands off, now, we're going back to camp.~
@2096 = ~This has done absolutely nothing to improve my concentration. Just so you know.~
@2097 = ~But maybe it's for the best. We're certainly not ready for taking this any farther.~
@2098 = ~(After another huge breath, Gavin begins to stroke your breast. His caress is gentle, but relentless. His fingers move over your skin as if he was memorizing your shape by touch.)~
@2099 = ~(At last, his fingertips brush your nipple. He pauses, as if waiting for your reaction.)~
@2100 = ~Don't stop, Gavin!~
@2101 = ~(Let him continue to explore your body.)~
@2102 = ~Lower, Gavin.~
@2103 = ~Fresh! Just the way I like it.~
@2104 = ~That's enough, Gavin.~
@2105 = ~Gods, I'm taking this too far! I need to stop this right now. We're just not ready for this. Not yet.~
@2106 = ~(For a few moments longer, he teases your nipple with his fingertips. Your bodies are pressed close, though, close enough for you to feel the extent of his excitement.)~
@2107 = ~(You reach down to stroke him.)~
@2108 = ~(You press your body more closely against him.)~
@2109 = ~Gavin, I think you're taking this a bit too far.~
@2110 = ~N-no! <CHARNAME>...	it's too much... I can't take it.~
@2111 = ~I know, Gavin. You need this.~
@2112 = ~Just let it happen. You'll feel better.~
@2113 = ~Not man enough for a little excitement?~
@2114 = ~I'm not sure I can, either.~
@2115 = ~Then by all the gods, stop! Don't do anything that makes you uncomfortable.~
@2116 = ~But we aren't ready for this!~
@2117 = ~We aren't going to lie together, Gavin. I'm just touching you, helping you relax. Think of it as a therapeutic massage.~
@2118 = ~Relax, Gavin. Deosn't it feel good?~
@2119 = ~I'll stop, then.~
@2120 = ~I've never had any kind of massage like this!~
@2121 = ~It's alright, Gavin. We care about each other, don't we? And there's nothing shameful about our bodies. So, let me do this one thing that will make you feel so much better.~
@2122 = ~Stop complaining! It isn't everyday you get this kind of attention.~
@2123 = ~Just relax. I know what I'm doing.~
@2124 = ~Do you want to stop?~
@2125 = ~No, but we should. I'm sorry, but I'm just not ready for this. Not yet.~
@2126 = ~(Though Gavin gives no voice to his consent, his resistance subsides. His arms close around you again, and he kisses you once more.)~
@2127 = ~(You wrap one arm around his hips to steady him and run another exploratory hand along the length of him.)~
@2128 = ~(You press your body closer against his.)~
@2129 = ~I'm not sure we should be doing this.~
@2130 = ~(Gavin responds immediately to the increased pressure against his pelvis. His arms tighten around you, his eyes close, and his head falls back. Almost imperceptibly, he begins to rub himself against you.)~
@2131 = ~If you sat down on that log over there, we could both enjoy this.~
@2132 = ~If you sat down on that crate over there, we could both enjoy this.~
@2133 = ~(You back up slightly and slide your hand inside his leggings.)~
@2134 = ~(You make some room between your bodies and begin to stroke him through his leggings.)~
@2135 = ~Gavin, I think we might be taking this a bit too far.~
@2136 = ~(Gavin freezes momentarily at your touch, almost breaking the embrace, then he relaxes. For a moment or two, he attempts to continue to kiss you, but the demands of his body soon make that impossible. His arms tighten around you again, but his eyes close and his head falls back.)~
@2137 = ~(You slide your hand inside his leggings.)~
@2138 = ~(You continue to stroke him through his leggings.)~
@2139 = ~I... I can't. The temptation to take you would be too great.~
@2140 = ~If we both stay fully clothed, you couldn't.~
@2141 = ~(You unlace his leggings so you can slide your hand inside.)~
@2142 = ~(You keep rubbing him through his leggings.)~
@2143 = ~I want you to take me.~
@2144 = ~Then maybe we should just go back.~
@2145 = ~I can't. I'm not prepared... and we're not ready for that.~
@2146 = ~You feel ready to me.~
@2147 = ~Prepared?~
@2148 = ~Please, Gavin! I need it, too.~
@2149 = ~Alright, I'll just touch.~
@2150 = ~Maybe we should just go back.~
@2151 = ~I don't know what to do! I know it's wrong for us to take this any further, but... well, you can feel my problem for yourself. And if you're just as bad...~
@2152 = ~But we can't. We mustn't.~
@2153 = ~If you sat down on that log over there, we could both enjoy this. We wouldn't even have to take our clothes off.~
@2154 = ~If you sat down on that crate over there, we could both enjoy this. We wouldn't even have to take our clothes off.~
@2155 = ~(You resume rubbing him through his leggings.)~
@2156 = ~It's probably for the best, though I hope this goes down a bit by the time we get back.~
@2157 = ~I'm sorry for inflicting myself on you like that.~
@2158 = ~I've taken nothing to keep me from getting you with child. Such a thing would be disastrous to your quest. But more importantly, we're not ready for that kind of commitment. At least not yet.~
@2159 = ~Physically? Yes. But we aren't ready for that kind of commitment... not yet.~
@2160 = ~But that's a sobering thought, and it's cleared my head enough to make me realize where you've got your hands.~
@2161 = ~I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>. I should never have let it get this far. We should go back before my appetites drive us to any greater madness.~
@2162 = ~(Gavin makes no further move to stop you. A few moments later, the weight of his arms around your shoulders increases as his knees start to buckle.)~
@2163 = ~Are you alright?~
@2164 = ~(You kiss his throat and keep stroking him.)~
@2165 = ~I can't hold you up, Gavin.~
@2166 = ~I think that's about enough for you.~
@2167 = ~Feels too good. Can't stand up.~
@2168 = ~<CHARNAME>... you'd better stop... almost...~
@2169 = ~It's alright, Gavin. Just let it go.~
@2170 = ~(You make no reply except to kiss him into silence and increase the tempo.)~
@2171 = ~(You snatch your hand away.)~
@2172 = ~Don't you dare!~
@2173 = ~(With one final shudder, he relaxes, panting into your hair, his arms heavy about your neck.)~
@2174 = ~Feel better?~
@2175 = ~That wasn't so bad, now, was it?~
@2176 = ~(You remain silent, letting him calm down.)~
@2177 = ~Oh, gods, what a mess.~
@2178 = ~I'm sorry... been so long...~
@2179 = ~(You feel him nodding, but he's still too out of breath to answer.)~
@2180 = ~(For several moments longer, he clings to you, his breathing almost a sob.)~
@2181 = ~(You put both arms around his waist and let him catch his breath.)~
@2182 = ~That was really something for you, wasn't it?~
@2183 = ~Are we happy now?~
@2184 = ~I seem to have gotten some on me.~
@2185 = ~(Gavin flinches at the touch of your hand against his bare flesh, but he makes no move to stop you. A few moments later, the weight of his arms around your shoulders increases as his knees start to buckle.)~
@2186 = ~(You snatch your hand from out of his leggings.)~
@2187 = ~(Gavin springs away from you, then stands panting, bent over with his hands on his knees and his head down.)~
@2188 = ~(He remains like that for several moments, then reluctantly straightens up and sighs.)~
@2189 = ~(Gavin groans, then shudders convulsively, despite the cessation of your attention.)~
@2190 = ~I'm sorry... that was too much for me to take.~
@2191 = ~(You feel him nodding, but he's still too out of breath to answer.~
@2192 = ~(You discretely remove your hand from his leggings, put both arms around his waist and let him catch his breath.)~
@2193 = ~Are you going to give me something to clean this up?~
@2194 = ~Aye... it was so intense...~
@2195 = ~Find a clean part of the leggings. They're getting washed tonight, anyway.~
@2196 = ~(Several moments later, his embrace loosens again. At last, his gasping quiets, and he sighs.)~
@2197 = ~Hells, <CHARNAME>, I'm at your mercy.~
@2198 = ~(He positions himself so you can sit astride him, then puts his arms around you again, rocking with you until you both find release.)~
@2199 = ~Oh, no... my leggings...~
@2200 = ~Don't fret, Gavin. The tunic hides everything.~
@2201 = ~No one can see anything. Besides, from the placement of the stains, you've got nothing to be ashamed of.~
@2202 = ~It's dark, Gavin. No one can see anything.~
@2203 = ~Some men would consider that a badge of pride.~
@2204 = ~It will wash out.~
@2205 = ~Hehe... that's so funny!~
@2206 = ~Then I hope you will forgive me if I see to the laundry when we get back.~
@2207 = ~I consider it a tribute to my lack of self-control.~
@2208 = ~It shouldn't have been like this, <CHARNAME>. There should have been soft candlelight, and music... not grappling by the roadside. We weren't ready.~
@2209 = ~Next time, there will be all those things, and next time, we will be. For now, though, we both needed this.~
@2210 = ~We were ready enough... or at least you were.~
@2211 = ~What's done is done.~
@2212 = ~No, we weren't ready. I should have waited.~
@2213 = ~I do feel much calmer... or will, once my pulse slows.~
@2214 = ~I enjoyed it, too.~
@2215 = ~Then I'm glad. That was the point behind this.~
@2216 = ~Well, it was worth it, then. No more distractions.~
@2217 = ~About time.~
@2218 = ~<CHARNAME>, I don't know what to say. If you resented... what I did... what I made you do, you should have stopped me. It wouldn't have been the first time I've gone to my bedroll frustrated.~
@2219 = ~It's alright, Gavin. You needed it.~
@2220 = ~It wasn't so bad. I enjoyed it, too.~
@2221 = ~Let's just go.~
@2222 = ~Next time, you will be going to your bedroll frustrated.~
@2223 = ~Next time I'm feeling so distracted, I'll be keeping it to myself. You're too important to me to risk your ill will for the sake of my pleasure.~
@2224 = ~I feel like a selfish bastard for seeking pleasure like that, but I am grateful. Thank you for... er... helping me clear my head.~
@2225 = ~I'm glad. I was feeling extraordinarily selfish, but if you got some pleasure from it, too, then maybe it was for the best.~
@2226 = ~If you must know, I didn't even last two heartbeats, and after lying with me once, she swore she'd never do it again.~
@2227 = ~You're older now. Your stamina might have improved.~
@2228 = ~Maybe you just need to learn some new techniques.~
@2229 = ~Just because she didn't want to doesn't mean no one else will.~
@2230 = ~That's pretty bad.~
@2231 = ~Aye, it is, and talking about it isn't improving my concentration.~
@2232 = ~Maybe, but if I'm ever going to find someone, it's going to have to wait until your quest is done and I'm settled somewhere.~
@2233 = ~Are we really having this conversation? Yes, there's a lot I'll need to learn, if the need ever arises, but I don't want to talk about it now.~
@2234 = ~<CHARNAME>, the truth is that you're the leader, we don't have that kind of relationship, and I respect you too much to use you.~
@2235 = ~It would be more the other way around.~
@2236 = ~I could order you to do it... for your own good.~
@2237 = ~Don't give me that crap. If I were beautiful beyond all measure and had a voice that could melt glaciers, you wouldn't be able to get your leggings down fast enough.~
@2238 = ~No. I'd have to carry my cloak more often than wear it, but I still wouldn't bed you. It has to mean something, <CHARNAME>. If I'm ever going to lie with a woman again, it's going to be the woman I spend the rest of my life with.~
@2239 = ~The answer is still no. I don't want to use you, and I don't want to be used by you either. I hope my decision doesn't make you reconsider my place in this group, but if it does, it does.~
@2240 = ~You mean one of our companions? I couldn't!~
@2241 = ~No, not anyone in the party! But you must know some woman who'd help you out.~
@2242 = ~What about Aerie?~
@2243 = ~What about 'Edwina?'~
@2244 = ~What about Imoen2?~
@2245 = ~What about Jaheira?~
@2246 = ~What about Mazzy?~
@2247 = ~What about Nalia?~
@2248 = ~What about Viconia?~
@2249 = ~What about <PLAYER2>?~
@2250 = ~What about <PLAYER3>?~
@2251 = ~What about <PLAYER4>?~
@2252 = ~What about <PLAYER5>?~
@2253 = ~What about <PLAYER6>?~
@2254 = ~Too many complications. I'd see her every day, and I couldn't bear the thought of her laughing at me.~
@2255 = ~Why would she laugh? You've got the same thing everybody else has got.~
@2256 = ~A bit underhung?~
@2257 = ~At least you'd feel better.~
@2258 = ~You'll never know unless you try.~
@2259 = ~Forget I said anything.~
@2260 = ~No, I'd feel worse, because every time I looked at her, I'd remember how pathetic I was with her.~
@2261 = ~No, that isn't it.~
@2262 = ~<CHARNAME>, I haven't been with a woman in ten years, and even then, I had no idea what I was doing. I'd be sure to disappoint her.~
@2263 = ~Bad idea. Compassion really isn't in her nature, and I don't even want to think about what she'd say if I asked her.~
@2264 = ~You never know. She seems to have quite an appetite for men.~
@2265 = ~Good point.~
@2266 = ~No, I couldn't. She's so young! Besides, she's got a crusade against injustice to run. She won't be interested in making some old cleric feel more relaxed.~
@2267 = ~I couldn't, <CHARNAME>. She's the kind of woman you'd want to marry and spend the rest of your lives conquering the forces of evil with. I doubt she'd be interested in a fling, even for my sake.~
@2268 = ~Even champions of Avoreen have needs, Gavin.~
@2269 = ~You never know. She can be pretty passionate, when she's interested in something.~
@2270 = ~She likes to help the needy, and you're about a needy as they come.~
@2271 = ~Even if that were the case, I'd be the last person she'd want. I haven't been with a woman in ten years, and I didn't know what I was doing then. I'd only disappoint her, and I couldn't live with that.~
@2272 = ~She's a bit too much woman for me to handle, to be perfectly honest with you. Besides, it's too soon after she lost her husband. It wouldn't feel right.~
@2273 = ~No, I couldn't ask her to do that, not after everything she's been through. Besides... no, I'd better keep that one to myself.~
@2274 = ~Out with it. What were you going to say?~
@2275 = ~Isn't she good enough for you?~
@2276 = ~Whatever. I tried.~
@2277 = ~There's something about her. If we were ever... together that way, I'd want it to be because we meant something to each other, not because she felt sorry for me.~
@2278 = ~But she's really a man!~
@2279 = ~You have something against men?~
@2280 = ~Yeah, but she's got great tits.~
@2281 = ~No, she's a woman who used to be a man.~
@2282 = ~You're awfully picky for somebody who can't get laid.~
@2283 = ~Eventually, that spell will wear off... or something.~
@2284 = ~Not at all. Some of my best friends are men. But I never wanted to get intimate with one of them.~
@2285 = ~I know she looks like a woman right now, but I know the truth, and I just couldn't. I really couldn't. Besides, she still shows a preference for women.~
@2286 = ~I think she's more interested in you, actually.~
@2287 = ~Er... not to put too fine a point on it, but she's yours.~
@2288 = ~I don't mind sharing.~
@2289 = ~It's for a good cause.~
@2290 = ~The truth is that she won't sleep with me, either. I'm hoping that if she agrees to it to help you, it would make the way easier for me.~
@2291 = ~I thought the three of us-~
@2292 = ~I couldn't. She's vulnerable, <CHARNAME>. I'd feel like I was using her.~
@2293 = ~That sounds so... unethical. I couldn't.~
@2294 = ~Even if I thought it was a good idea, which I don't, there's still her feelings to consider. I doubt she'd be willing, even if you were.~
@2295 = ~Oh my. No, <CHARNAME>, I really couldn't do that. I just couldn't.~
@2296 = ~You mean she'd lie with me out of sympathy? No thanks.~
@2297 = ~Thanks for trying to help, but I think I just need some time alone. This mood should pass by morning. It usually does.~
@2298 = ~I guess that's better than doing nothing.~
@2299 = ~So, what's the first thing you're going to do when you finally get a chance to put your feet up and relax?~ [bgav118]
@2300 = ~Do you mean before or after I get my soul back?~
@2301 = ~I'm going to spend three days in my nightshirt and read every novel I can get my hands on.~
@2302 = ~I'm going to find out exactly how much drink it takes to forget the last two years of my life.~
@2303 = ~I intend to consult the most knowledgable sages in the Realms and find out how it is that you can be as clumsy as you are and not actually kill yourself.~
@2304 = ~I don't know. I'm pretty relaxed right now, as a matter of fact.~
@2305 = ~I'm not telling, but here's a hint. If you need to get word to me for some reason, you'll have to slip a note under my bedroom door.~
@2306 = ~I wouldn't make any plans that involve leaving the bedroom for a week or two, if I were you.~
@2307 = ~I think I might do some traveling. See the world.~
@2308 = ~I'm going to build a scale model of Baldur's Gate, complete with movable doors, miniature people, and a drawbridge that opens and closes.~
@2309 = ~I have no idea, but it's going to be something grand.~
@2310 = ~I'm not going to do a damned thing. That's rather the point, isn't it?~
@2311 = ~Not a clue.~
@2312 = ~Er... right. I don't believe I actually said something that stupid.~
@2313 = ~It's alright, Gavin. After all, I probably don't act a lot different.~
@2314 = ~It's this gift you have.~
@2315 = ~It's because you're so self-absorbed.~
@2316 = ~I believe it. There's no end to the witless things that come out of your mouth.~
@2317 = ~You don't, and that's the frightening part.~
@2318 = ~And all this time, I thought that perhaps I might be remembered for something meaningful, like my devotion to Lathander, or for something embarrassing, like my ability to engage multiple enemies without achieving a single successful kill.~
@2319 = ~Heh. That would be the famous <CHARNAME> sense of humor, I presume?~
@2320 = ~Well, there's an end to it now, then. This conversation is just about done.~
@2321 = ~We already talked about recovering your soul, though, so I suppose it's pointless to speculate how you'll feel once you get it back until it actually happens.~
@2322 = ~Still, it's good to know you care.~
@2323 = ~At this point, it doesn't look like it's going to happen any time soon.~
@2324 = ~You sound like you're unsure that it actually will happen.~
@2325 = ~Yup.~
@2326 = ~Of course I care, and I'll help you in any way that I can.~
@2327 = ~No, it will happen, and I'll do anything I can to make sure of it.~
@2328 = ~I'd probably do the same.~
@2329 = ~That's a lot of ale.~
@2330 = ~Heh. Don't bother consulting the sages. The best answer I've found is 'dumb luck.'~
@2331 = ~Really? With everything that's going on?~
@2332 = ~Can't say I blame you.~
@2333 = ~I like the sound of that!~
@2334 = ~Yes, there is a difference between traveling for pleasure and dragging yourself all over Faerun because you have to.~
@2335 = ~Can I play with it when you're done?~
@2336 = ~I'm sure it will be.~
@2337 = ~I suppose it is.~
@2338 = ~You'll think of something, I'm sure.~
@2339 = ~We might not be done with our task, but maybe we can have a bit of fun, maybe blow off a bit of steam. It keeps things from getting to be too much.~
@2340 = ~[ANOMEN] We must not allow ourselves to be diverted from our mission.~
@2341 = ~[JAN] You need to lighten up, Ano, my friend. Don't be a spoilsport.~
@2342 = ~[KORGAN] Ah, let's just go get drunk.~
@2343 = ~[ANOMEN] Bah. We have better things to do than indulge in such foolishness.~
@2344 = ~[JAHEIRA] It would be good to get out and enjoy nature more.~
@2345 = ~[VALYGAR] I'm not complaining, but we already are.~
@2346 = ~[VALYGAR] That sounds good to me.~
@2347 = ~[NALIA] How can you even think of idle amusements while so many people are suffering?~
@2348 = ~[VICONIA] I care nothing for that.~
@2349 = ~[YOSHIMO] Can I interest anyone in a game of dice, perhaps?~
@2350 = ~[KELDORN] Not with your dice, thief.~
@2351 = ~[EDWIN] Whatever you're going to do, kindly do it away from me. I intend to spend the evening preparing my spells.~
@2352 = ~[MINSC] Have no fear. I shall avoid you, no matter what <CHARNAME> decides.~
@2353 = ~[AERIE]I know! We could play charades.~
@2354 = ~[KORGAN] Bah, that's no fun. You always do a bird.~
@2355 = ~[CERND] I cannot speak for the rest, but I would benefit from some solitude.~
@2356 = ~[JAHEIRA] As would we all, I think.~
@2357 = ~[JAN] I hear there's a turnip festival going on in the Bridge District. That would be fun, and educational, too!~
@2358 = ~[MAZZY] Perhaps, if you don't mind flatulence. I would prefer to avoid it, myself.~
@2359 = ~[MINSC] I don't know. Too much excitement makes Boo squirrely.~
@2360 = ~[IMOEN] Oh, let him play, Minsc. He needs some fun, too.~
@2361 = ~[MAZZY] An evening of quiet relaxation would be welcome, I think.~
@2362 = ~[CERND] Indeed. The thistle grows best when it is left undisturbed.~
@2363 = ~[VICONIA] I have no liking for your petty amusements.~
@2364 = ~[EDWIN] Are you certain? You could learn much of pleasure from a Red Wizard.~
@2365 = ~[VALYGAR] As long as you leave me alone, you can do whatever you like.~
@2366 = ~[YOSHIMO] You are alone too much, Valygar. It would do you good to be around others more often.~
@2367 = ~[IMOEN] We should get ourselves some berry pies. They're awfully good, this time of year.~
@2368 = ~[AERIE] Ooh, I like pies!~
@2369 = ~[KELDORN] I do have a book I've been meaning to read.~
@2370 = ~[NALIA] Is it any good? Maybe I can borrow it when you're done.~
@2371 = ~So, any idea what you'd like to do?~
@2372 = ~Whatever it is, it won't involve drinking. You got us in too much trouble last time.~
@2373 = ~I'm too tired to even think that far ahead.~
@2374 = ~Probably just fall into nightmare-filled sleep, like I do every night.~
@2375 = ~I want a good meal.~
@2376 = ~Stop by my bedroll later and I'll tell you there.~
@2377 = ~Hmm, yes, we definitely don't want that happening again.~
@2378 = ~Then maybe we should call it quits soon.~
@2379 = ~You're still having nightmares? I'm sorry to hear that.~
@2380 = ~Then a good meal you shall have.~
@2381 = ~(gulp) I... er... don't know if that's such a good idea.~
@2382 = ~I shall obey your every desire.~
@2383 = ~When this is all over, I think that maybe I'll settle in Athkatla.~ [bgav119]
@2384 = ~I thought you hated cities!~
@2385 = ~That wouldn't suit me at all.~
@2386 = ~Didn't we already decide where we're going to live?~
@2387 = ~I was thinking along those lines myself. Maybe we'll be neighbors.~
@2388 = ~I was thinking along those lines myself.~
@2389 = ~It's as good a place as any.~
@2390 = ~I'm not fond of cities at all, Athkatla, especially, but I think I'm needed here.~
@2391 = ~It doesn't really suit me, either, but I think I'm needed here.~
@2392 = ~Hmm. I certainly wouldn't make you live somewhere you hated, but I think I'm needed here.~
@2393 = ~We did, but I think I'm needed here.~
@2394 = ~I'd feel sorry for you, then, having to look at this face every time you stepped outside your door. I think I'm needed here, though.~
@2395 = ~That works out well then. I think I'm needed here.~
@2396 = ~There's already a temple of Lathander here, but it needs rejuvenation. Ours is not a faith that encourages believers to shut themselves behind an impressive marble facade and seek enlightenment in solitude. We're meant to go out and actively minister to others, encouraging everyone to better their lives and the lives of those around them.~
@2397 = ~Are you contemplating some kind of crusade?~
@2398 = ~I'm surprised to hear you say that. You've always avoided leadership roles.~
@2399 = ~You're setting yourself up for disappointment, Gavin. One man can't do everything you want to do.~
@2400 = ~The Lathandrites here don't lack enthusiasm or leadership, they lack members. They just don't have enough resources to do what you want to do.~
@2401 = ~You're meddling in the affairs of others again.~
@2402 = ~Maybe I am.~
@2403 = ~I have always deferred to others, and I don't relish the responsibility that comes with leadership, but there comes a time when you have to do what is right, even if it means doing something you don't want to do.~
@2404 = ~You can do this. You have the ability. You just need to have confidence.~
@2405 = ~It's worth doing, Gavin. I'll give you whatever support I can.~
@2406 = ~Are you sure you're up to this?~
@2407 = ~You mean well, but I know you'll never do it.~
@2408 = ~Do you really think you can just walk right into the temple and say 'There are going to be some changes around here, so toe the line and do as I say?'~
@2409 = ~No, one man can't do half of what I want to do, but one man may inspire others.~
@2410 = ~Now that the cult is destroyed, that should change. We've always enjoyed the patronage of the nobility, so we have funds at our disposal. We just need enthusiastic, motivated people who want to see it done.~
@2411 = ~No, not meddling, because we don't believe in forcing others in matters of faith. If you said 'inspiring others,' you might be nearer to the mark.~
@2412 = ~I have very little confidence in myself, but I have a great deal of faith in the Morninglord. Lathander's power flows through me, and with it, I can do anything.~
@2413 = ~Keep it up, and I'm going to start calling you Tiax.~
@2414 = ~Your faith is admirable, but I'd rather you believed in yourself more. You have talents of your own.~
@2415 = ~We've all come a long way since we started. I think you can do it.~
@2416 = ~You're starting to sound like a fanatic.~
@2417 = ~You can do anything, eh? Let me see you leap over that log over there.~
@2418 = ~You can do anything, eh? Let me see you leap over that barrel over there.~
@2419 = ~You're mad. Stark, raving mad.~
@2420 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. I'll probably need it.~
@2421 = ~You're wrong, <CHARNAME>. I *will* do it.~
@2422 = ~I know it won't be that easy. High Mornmaster Arval leads the temple, and I have no desire to challenge his leadership. The Lathandrite church is not like other faiths, though. Clerics congregate together and form temples, but each individual priest acts according to the dictates of his conscience and his beliefs. If I propose changes, some will follow me.~
@2423 = ~Heh. If I ever say 'Gavin rules all!' kill me dead. Please.~
@2424 = ~If I do, they're cleverly buried under a mass of general incompetence, but I thank you nonetheless.~
@2425 = ~It's a hazard of the trade, I fear. There are times when I reflect on the might and the majesty of Lathander with awe, and I wonder how great his power must be, if the small fraction that I possess can accomplish so much.~
@2426 = ~You really want to see me end up in a heap, don't you? I said I can do the incredible, not the impossible, and feats of dexterity will always be the latter, I fear.~
@2427 = ~Maybe I am, but you're the one who keeps me on.~
@2428 = ~Thank you. Your faith in me is reassuring.~
@2429 = ~We still have a long way to go before any of this becomes reality, though, and I've talked for long enough. Let's continue onward, and get a little closer to achieving our goals before we rest.~
@2430 = ~<CHARNAME>... we have become close, in the time we've spent together, and in you, I sense a kindred spirit. How I ever knew happiness before I met you, I do not know, but I do know that I have found it now.~ [bgav120]
@2431 = ~Yet every day, we face trials and danger that could claim either of us. Life is uncertain, but I know I love you. I...~
@2432 = ~I have neither wealth nor power, nor any great cunning or strength of arms. My faith is unshakable, though, and I offer it to you, and all the powers the Morninglord bestows on me.~
@2433 = ~I can promise you nothing but my heart and my eternal devotion, but I offer these gladly if you will consent to be my wife.~
@2434 = ~Will you marry me?~
@2435 = ~Yes! Of course I'll marry you!~
@2436 = ~I've been thinking about that myself, and I think it's an excellent idea.~
@2437 = ~Well! Isn't this a surprise! I accept.~
@2438 = ~This is so sudden... I need more time.~
@2439 = ~Oh, Gavin... I hate to disappoint you, but can't we just leave things the way they are?~
@2440 = ~So... what exactly do you expect out of this?~
@2441 = ~I don't know, Gavin. If you wanted to become lovers, I would have no objection, but marriage...~
@2442 = ~I've been dreading this. I know you care deeply for me, Gavin, but I can't return your feelings right now.~
@2443 = ~Well, you certainly caught me off guard. I never thought you would take our flirtation so seriously. I'm sorry, Gavin, but I can't.~
@2444 = ~I'm sorry, Gavin, but there's someone else.~
@2445 = ~I never asked for your love, Gavin, and now that you've offered it, I've got to say that I'm repulsed by it. I most certainly don't want it, now or ever.~
@2446 = ~Marry you? Are you mad?~
@2447 = ~Oh, most beloved <CHARNAME>... thank you!~
@2448 = ~(He kisses you tenderly, though you can sense his barely-contained emotion.)~
@2449 = ~(You kiss him passionately.)~
@2450 = ~Mmmm, yes...~
@2451 = ~I love you, but it's time for bed.~
@2452 = ~(Gavin's kiss becomes more passionate, and you feel his pulse quicken.)~
@2453 = ~(You respond to the increased urgency of his embrace by kissing him even more ardently, stroking his back and pressing your body against his.)~
@2454 = ~(You don't break the embrace, but you resist his advances, pulling away from him.)~
@2455 = ~Gavin, no. It's too soon.~
@2456 = ~Yes, love, it is...~
@2457 = ~And... and I have to ask you...~
@2458 = ~You can say no, and I will love you no less, nor will I ever pressure you otherwise, but...~
@2459 = ~Will you... will you have me as your lover, as well as your future husband?~
@2460 = ~Yes!~
@2461 = ~Isn't it a little soon? You just confessed your love a moment ago.~
@2462 = ~No, Gavin. I will come to you when I am ready, but let us treasure each memory for its distinct beauty.~
@2463 = ~Let's save one joy for our wedding night.~
@2464 = ~I won't bed you now, because if I did, I would always wonder whether you confessed your love just to get me to lie with you.~
@2465 = ~I did, didn't I? I've said it so many times in my heart that I'd forgotten that I only said it aloud just now.~
@2466 = ~Then that is exactly what we will do. I know that I will certainly treasure this moment forever.~
@2467 = ~If you want to wait, then that is what we will do. I am so delighted that you will have me, I will wait however long it takes.~
@2468 = ~Never, beloved! Your love is more than enough to make me happy, but to allay your fears, we'll wait. If you allow me to come to your bed at all, it will be at your invitation, not by my request.~
@2469 = ~So... you want to wait, I take it?~
@2470 = ~I want to wait.~
@2471 = ~No, I just wanted to make sure your heart was in it.~
@2472 = ~No, I just wanted to make sure you were ready.~
@2473 = ~Oh, yes. Very, very much so.~
@2474 = ~(Emboldened by your passion, his hands move over your body even as he kisses you. The lightness of his clothing and the closeness of your bodies conceal nothing. You feel his chest expand with every ragged breath, you feel his body tremble with excitement... and you feel his desire rising between you.)~
@2475 = ~Come, Gavin. Let's go to bed.~
@2476 = ~(You slide your hands under his shirt and continue to stroke him.)~
@2477 = ~(You loosen your clothing and guide his hands to more sensitive parts of your body.)~
@2478 = ~(You do not break the embrace, but you do nothing to encourage him to greater passion.)~
@2479 = ~Gavin, no. I thought I could, but it's too soon.~
@2480 = ~(Gavin shivers as your cool fingers slide over his skin. You feel him tense slightly as your fingertips brush the scar beneath his shoulderblade, but he offers no resistance as you explore his torso.)~
@2481 = ~(Lean muscles slide under your hands as he moves, tenderly stroking your hair, neck, and back.)~
@2482 = ~(Gavin's touch is timid, at first. He strokes your neck and collarbone before lowering his fingertips to caress your breast through your clothing.)~
@2483 = ~Is something wrong, my love?~
@2484 = ~This is new to me, Gavin. I've never been with a man before.~
@2485 = ~This is our first time together, Gavin. I want to savor each moment.~
@2486 = ~Nothing is wrong, but your arousal is too great. You will spend yourself too soon, if you keep this up.~
@2487 = ~Your passion is a bit overwhelming.~
@2488 = ~I'm starting to think it might be a mistake to bed each other so soon. Our emotions might lead us to do something rash.~
@2489 = ~It doesn't feel right, Gavin. I think we should wait until we're married.~
@2490 = ~Do you want me to stop?~
@2491 = ~Maybe you'd better stop.~
@2492 = ~No, don't stop, just go slow.~
@2493 = ~No, I want to make love to you. I just needed to breathe.~
@2494 = ~As do I, beloved.~
@2495 = ~Yes, you're right... I will try to go more slowly.~
@2496 = ~(Gavin's breath is a shuddering gasp.) I'm having all I can do to keep myself in check, love. I'm sorry, but I've wanted this moment for so long, it's hard to control myself. Do you want me to stop?~
@2497 = ~Perhaps you are right. I don't know about you, but my emotions are certainly giving me all kinds of impulsive suggestions.~
@2498 = ~(With obvious reluctance, Gavin relaxes his embrace, though he does not release you quite yet.)~
@2499 = ~I am sorry, love. I was carried away by the moment, but if you want to wait, I can wait.~
@2500 = ~Just a little while, Gavin. What happened tonight was special, but making love will be, too. I want to treasure each memory separately.~
@2501 = ~It just feels so rushed. A few moments ago, we were just holding hands and stealing kisses. I don't know if I'm ready to discover you that completely quite yet.~
@2502 = ~This is a side of you I've never seen before, and the intimacy is a little frightening.~
@2503 = ~I think we should wait until we're married.~
@2504 = ~How do I know you didn't tell me you love me just to get me to lie with you?~
@2505 = ~(Gavin's arms tighten around you. He brings your lips to his again, and kisses you slowly, savoring each moment.)~
@2506 = ~(If he was trembling before, his body is still now, though his movements suggest an energy barely contained. His touch is gentle, but purposeful... and awkward. He pauses.)~
@2507 = ~<CHARNAME>, my love, I... I want to please you, but I don't know how.~
@2508 = ~You said you've done this before.~
@2509 = ~You're doing fine, Gavin. Your body knows what to do, even if your brain does not.~
@2510 = ~We need to start by getting rid of some of this clothing.~
@2511 = ~It's alright, Gavin. Let's go back to what we were doing, and I'll guide you through it.~
@2512 = ~You need to slow down or you'll never last.~
@2513 = ~Maybe this is too much too soon. Maybe we should try this on a night when our emotions aren't already getting the better of us.~
@2514 = ~Be a man, Gavin. Take what you want.~
@2515 = ~I've got the most beautiful, wonderful woman in all Faerun in my arms, and you have to remind me of that now?~
@2516 = ~I was young, barely more than a boy... and to say the truth, it was all over almost before it started. The... experience was so brief, and so overwhelming, that I barely realized what had happened.~
@2517 = ~But I'm a man now... and just as inexperienced as I was then.~
@2518 = ~My body is full of suggestions, just now, but I'm not sure how much liberty I should give it.~
@2519 = ~(gulp) Yes... er... <CHARNAME>...~
@2520 = ~(Gavin eagerly resumes his lovemaking, but after a short while, draws away again, his face full of concern.)~
@2521 = ~I probably won't, anyway...~
@2522 = ~I don't know if I'll be any calmer, then, but you're probably right. My emotions are certainly making some intense demands of me, at the moment.~
@2523 = ~(Gavin groans and resumes his lovemaking in earnest, but after a short while, he pulls away, gasping.)~
@2524 = ~Sweet <CHARNAME>, I desperately want to please you... or at least not disappoint you too much, though I fear that I probably will...~
@2525 = ~Relax, Gavin. Your heart will guide you... and if you run out of ideas, I'm sure we can come up with something together.~
@2526 = ~You don't need to be the best lover Faerun has ever known, love. You just have to mean it.~
@2527 = ~Don't be nervous, Gavin. We love each other, and that's all that matters.~
@2528 = ~Less talk, more lovemaking...~
@2529 = ~You need to be confident, or you will fail.~
@2530 = ~If you do, we can always try again.~
@2531 = ~If you're so unsure of your abilities, maybe we should wait.~
@2532 = ~I hope so, love. Very, very much.~
@2533 = ~That's good, because I can almost promise you I won't be. But I will try, nonetheless.~
@2534 = ~We do... and you're right.~
@2535 = ~So, no pressure, eh? Well, I'll do my best.~
@2536 = ~I like the sound of that.~
@2537 = ~I don't know if waiting will help. I'll be no more experienced then. But I will wait, if you want to.~
@2538 = ~It's all right, Gavin. I'm sure you'll be fine.~
@2539 = ~Then let's see what we can do about making you more experienced. Starting now.~
@2540 = ~Let's wait. There's no point in rushing now.~
@2541 = ~(With a happy sigh, Gavin cradles your face in his hands and brings your lips to his again. He kisses you deeply, slowly.)~
@2542 = ~(The sounds of the world recede until the only music you hear is your own beating hearts. At last, that too fades to a murmer, and you fall asleep in each others' arms.)~
@2543 = ~Oh...~
@2544 = ~Well, I had considered this as one possible outcome. I had hoped you would say yes, of course, but...~
@2545 = ~Let us continue as we were, then. Maybe a day will come when you feel more able to...~
@2546 = ~What do I expect? I don't know. I hoped you might agree to accept me as your future husband. I feared you might reject me utterly. But I certainly don't know what to expect. What do you mean, exactly?~
@2547 = ~Do you think that after a few easily spoken words and hollow promises, I will accept you as my lover?~
@2548 = ~If I say yes, would you expect me to run away with you to be married this moment?~
@2549 = ~If I say no, will you be heartbroken?~
@2550 = ~If I need more time to decide, will you give it to me?~
@2551 = ~Do you think that commitment excuses you from having to work to keep my affection?~
@2552 = ~I just wanted to know if you had any clear idea what you were getting yourself into, with such a declaration.~
@2553 = ~Your lover? Well, I hoped that one day you might allow it, but when and where would be your choice, if at all.~
@2554 = ~I meant that I wanted to form a bond with you, a promise that we would unite with each other someday in the eyes of our peoples and in the eyes of our gods...~
@2555 = ~And even if those words seemed easily spoken to you, I assure you they were not. I've been agonizing over them for days, and I'm still pretty sure I got it wrong, now that I've seen your reaction.~
@2556 = ~No, of course not. It would be foolish to act so suddenly, without letting it sink in a bit.~
@2557 = ~That would depend on whether you said that you wanted more time to decide or whether you said you wanted nothing further to do with me.~
@2558 = ~If all you need is time, I would give that gladly, but if you reject me completely...~
@2559 = ~Heartbroken is not too strong a word.~
@2560 = ~Yes, of course! I would not want to rush any decision this important.~
@2561 = ~No, I understand that any understanding between two people requires work as well as commitment. I am afraid of neither.~
@2562 = ~I know. I've laid my feelings bare, with no falsehood or deception. I want you for my wife, and I know well the solemnity of that promise.~
@2563 = ~But now, the words are said, and they cannot be taken back, even if I wanted to. You have heard my plea. Will you have me?~
@2564 = ~I will.~
@2565 = ~I'm sorry, Gavin, but I need more time.~
@2566 = ~I would rather leave things as they are, at least for now.~
@2567 = ~Marriage is a big step, Gavin, and not one I am willing to take. Could we not just become lovers?~
@2568 = ~I'm sorry, Gavin. I know you care deeply for me, but I can't return your feelings right now.~
@2569 = ~To be perfectly honest with you, I never thought you would take our flirting so seriously. I'm sorry, Gavin, but I just don't feel for you what you feel for me.~
@2570 = ~Have you? What a revolting thought! And that means no. Not now, not ever.~
@2571 = ~You must be insane.~
@2572 = ~You mean, become lovers with no oath or bond between us? No, <CHARNAME>, I could not. My love for you is built on the hope of a future together, and without that...~
@2573 = ~(sigh) But I know my faults. Without the hope of life together, my love for you would die.~
@2574 = ~But why must it be that way? I cannot commit to you, but I do want you as a lover.~
@2575 = ~No, Gavin, I would not want you to live like that. Hold on to your hope, and one day... Who knows what may happen tomorrow?~
@2576 = ~Gavin, you read too much into our flirtation. It was pleasant for both of us, but I never intended for you to fall in love with me.~
@2577 = ~I can't give you an answer right now. I need to think about it some more.~
@2578 = ~If you rejected me outright, but with kindness, I would keep hoping and praying that one day, your heart would change, and you would accept me. My love for you could survive that.~
@2579 = ~But if you demanded that I allow myself to... lie with you, with no hope, no promise of a future, I would have to accept that you could never care for me.~
@2580 = ~To my shame, I probably would give in to you.... because you are what you are, and if... satisfying your desires helped you defeat the obstacles you face...~
@2581 = ~It would be a great sacrifice, I won't deny it. I would feel used, and a part of me would die in making it. But I would do it, because you must succeed.~
@2582 = ~That is what I want.~
@2583 = ~No, Gavin, I would not ask you to sacrifice your beliefs, even for the sake of my own desires.~
@2584 = ~I don't want that, no. I never asked for your love, and now that you've declared it, I have to reject it. That's all there is to say.~
@2585 = ~You sound like a reluctant martyr being led to the slaughter. It's just an act, Gavin, the simple scratching of an itch. But since you seem to regard it as something deeply spiritual, I won't demand it of you.~
@2586 = ~I'm going to ask you again, because once we're on this course, there is no turning back.~
@2587 = ~If you make me your lover without any vows between us, I will lose respect for you. I do all you ask of me, but never again will I trust you.~
@2588 = ~And if ever you send me from your side, even that will end between us, and I will never be anything more than a friend, even if I do consent to travel with you again.~
@2589 = ~Now I ask you again. Is this really what you want?~
@2590 = ~It is.~
@2591 = ~I don't know if I'm ready for that. Maybe I just need more time to think about commitment.~
@2592 = ~I can't agree to marry you, and I wouldn't ask you to do something you don't want to do for me. Maybe we should just end it, at least for now.~
@2593 = ~So what do we do?~
@2594 = ~Maybe all we need is time. Let's change nothing between us and see how things go.~
@2595 = ~I'm not ready to promise you anything, but I don't want you to do anything you don't want to do. As much as I don't want to, maybe we should end it, at least for now.~
@2596 = ~I don't know.~
@2597 = ~I appreciate that. But it does lead to another question.~
@2598 = ~(sigh) So be it.~
@2599 = ~I'll do as you ask, but not now. The wound is still too fresh.~
@2600 = ~Then let us continue on as we were. There is time enough to decide later.~
@2601 = ~Not what I hoped to hear, but I must accept your choice. Should you change your mind...~
@2602 = ~But no, I will not ask for more than your kindness in rejecting me gently.~
@2603 = ~I... I see. Well, I will not stand between you and...~
@2604 = ~I will not stand in your way.~
@2605 = ~Ouch. That hurt.~
@2606 = ~But you have certainly let me know how you feel about me. I will take it to heart, and find whatever consolation in the totality of your rejection that I may.~
@2607 = ~How could you ever imagine that I could want you?~
@2608 = ~You must know that another holds my heart.~
@2609 = ~It was never more than flirtation between us Gavin. I am sorry you thought it was more.~
@2610 = ~I just can't. Not right now. I thought you knew.~
@2611 = ~How can you expect me to make a decision like that now, with the world falling apart around us?~
@2612 = ~It's just that it's so rushed. I need more time to think.~
@2613 = ~How could you ever doubt my love for you? Of course I'll marry you!~
@2614 = ~Well, I'd better let you get some rest. Sleep well, <CHARNAME>.~
@2615 = ~So sleep well, my love, and dream of sweet things. I will dream of you, and give thanks to Lathander for our love.~
@2616 = ~I've been thinking... maybe it wasn't you.~ [bgav121]
@2617 = ~What?~
@2618 = ~Oh, it was me, all right. Whatever you heard, it's true.~
@2619 = ~Oh, it was me, all right. You were there, you saw.~
@2620 = ~If it wasn't me, who was it?~
@2621 = ~Of course it wasn't me.~
@2622 = ~I was wrong to hold you fully responsible for the wrongness in your soul. I should have been more tolerant, considering the blood you bear.~
@2623 = ~Is that an apology?~
@2624 = ~So that makes you my best friend, does it?~
@2625 = ~The 'wrongness of my soul?' Who are you to say what's right or wrong?~
@2626 = ~So, I can get away with anything, just because I'm a <PRO_RACE>?~
@2627 = ~I don't follow you. You're human, too.~
@2628 = ~Too little, too late, Gavin.~
@2629 = ~You walked away from the hand I offered you once before. I won't give you the chance to do it again.~
@2630 = ~I never really understood it myself, but now that I know what I am, it makes more sense.~
@2631 = ~I'm not saying you did not do what you did. I'm just saying that I was wrong in blaming only you for it.~
@2632 = ~I don't expect you to trust me. Maybe someday, but not now.~
@2633 = ~That's what I'm apologizing for. I was doing just that, by judging you as if you did not...~
@2634 = ~I wasn't talking about the blood you got from your mother.~
@2635 = ~Yet you accepted me into your company not once, but twice. Won't you at least hear me out?~
@2636 = ~Oh, all right. Say your bit, but no promises.~
@2637 = ~Why not? I'm feeling magnaminous today.~
@2638 = ~You're valuable as a healer and a meat shield. Learn your place.~
@2639 = ~I can't explain why I "accepted your company." You're impossible, and yet... I don't know. There's something about you...~
@2640 = ~You're as welcome here as any fit, muscular male would be. You stay as long as I find you easy to look at.~
@2641 = ~I might have accepted you, but that doesn't mean I'm going to keep you. Don't push your luck.~
@2642 = ~I guess you've got about as much to learn about all this as everybody else.~
@2643 = ~You're the <PRO_SONDAUGHTER> of Bhaal. That's a heavy burden to bear, and I can hardly blame you for staggering under the weight of it.~
@2644 = ~You're giving Bhaal credit for more influence in my life than he holds.~
@2645 = ~It's impossible, Gavin. I feel this urge to hurt things, and it never ends.~
@2646 = ~You're making excuses for me, but the truth is that I like who I am. I have no desire to change.~
@2647 = ~I'm more interested in seeing how I do under the weight of *you*.~
@2648 = ~So why do you stay, if you find me so fallible?~
@2649 = ~I had hoped you would not resemble your father so much.~
@2650 = ~<CHARNAME>, I... I had better get to the point.~
@2651 = ~(gulp) <CHARNAME>, I'm afriad you might have the wrong idea about me.~
@2652 = ~Please, Gavin, don't make me ill. I have no desire to bed you. You are easy to look at, however, provided I ignore everything from the neck up.~
@2653 = ~There's something about you that draws me in, even though I know what you are.~
@2654 = ~Are you sure? You might enjoy a tumble.~
@2655 = ~Lathander is the god of athletics and virility, no? How do his priests measure up?~
@2656 = ~And making you blush is such a delight. I do believe I can see the sunrise in your face, just now.~
@2657 = ~I do not tolerate poor performers in my company. I am not saying that I will require your services, but if I do, you will provide them or you will go.~
@2658 = ~Ha! As if! You moron, do you really think I would accept you? But now I know: you think with your balls, even as you mouth pious words.~
@2659 = ~Don't trouble yourself. I'm only looking.~
@2660 = ~I can only hope that you...~
@2661 = ~No. I'll keep that thought to myself. You probably think me a fool already, without sharing the pleas I offer my god on your behalf.~
@2662 = ~This conversation is going nowhere. It would be best if we got back to what we were doing.~
@2663 = ~Ilmater's mercy, <CHARNAME>, if you really are that shallow, you have eyes to see for yourself. It would do you more good, however, to think of the state of your soul.~
@2664 = ~You worry about keeping my body alive and healthy, and leave the worry over my soul to me.~
@2665 = ~My, aren't you moody! One moment, you're contrite over judging me for being a Bhaalspawn, the next, you're berating me for admitting my urges.~
@2666 = ~Can't blame a girl for trying. One of these days, Gavin, I'm going to find out what you keep under your clothing, and you're going to be sorry you held out so long.~
@2667 = ~Gavin, you silly little man, can't you tell when someone is joking?~
@2668 = ~Relax, Gavin. I know how far I can push you.~
@2669 = ~Why do I let myself be baited like this? Never mind.~
@2670 = ~I... <CHARNAME>, do you know what you're asking? I'm Lathander's Dawnbringer. There are things I can't do.~
@2671 = ~Why? Are you mutilated in some way?~
@2672 = ~Then stop wasting my time and get out of my sight.~
@2673 = ~Lathander doesn't have a problem with one person giving another physical pleasure, does he?~
@2674 = ~You're still the same old Gavin, all right. Never mind. Just try to make yourself useful.~
@2675 = ~After everything you have been through, I would not have expected you to do something so childish. Saying suggestive things and then blaming a man for thinking along those suggestions isn't clever, it's juvenile.~
@2676 = ~No, but I can't condone slavery, and you're asking me to become one.~
@2677 = ~Oh, very well. Have it your own way, then.~
@2678 = ~Can't you tell when I'm teasing you?~
@2679 = ~You'll do as you're told or you'll get out of my sight!~
@2680 = ~As you wish. Farewell.~
@2681 = ~When one is unwilling, he does.~
@2682 = ~I'll try, but I'm warning you now that if you push me too far, I will have to leave.~
@2683 = ~Save yourself the trouble. Do it now.~
@2684 = ~I think I know how hard I can push you.~
@2685 = ~If you survive. You are expendable.~
@2686 = ~No, Gavin, don't go. I shouldn't tease you like that, but I just can't seem to stop myself.~
@2687 = ~I hoped things would be different this time, but I see that I was wrong. Farewell.~
@2688 = ~If not, you'll learn.~
@2689 = ~No, I'm not. There is a child in a temple who needs me, if you don't. Farewell.~
@2690 = ~I hope that I'm not. I would hope that you did not consciously decide to become...~
@2691 = ~I know, <CHARNAME>. It must be unbearable. But now that you know, you can resist it. You don't have to be a slave of your blood.~
@2692 = ~That's what I was afraid of. <CHARNAME>... no, I've said enough for now. Let's get back to what we were doing.~
@2693 = ~Quite sure.~
@2694 = ~<CHARNAME>, I begin to think we've about exhausted this conversation, but I have to at least try.~
@2695 = ~You might be the child of Bhaal, but you are also a <PRO_MANWOMAN>. I want to help you. I only hope I can.~
@2696 = ~ I think you finding me in that temple happened for a reason. Maybe...~
@2697 = ~Maybe your soul is reaching out, striving for freedom from the taint of the blood you bear. Maybe I can help you.~
@2698 = ~And here I thought it was just the lure of a nice pair of shoulders.~
@2699 = ~I don't think it's anything that lofty.~
@2700 = ~It's nothing I can explain.~
@2701 = ~I've heard stranger things.~
@2702 = ~It seems too unlikely to be even possible.~
@2703 = ~And then you say something like that, and I wonder how I can stand to be near you.~
@2704 = ~Have you ever stopped to listen to the words that come out of your mouth?~
@2705 = ~I'll try to bear it, but you have to promise you'll try to fight the evil of the blood you bear.~
@2706 = ~Fight it? Why would I want to do that? It's a blessing, not a curse.~
@2707 = ~I can't make any promises, but I'll try.~
@2708 = ~I only wish it was that easy.~
@2709 = ~You have no right to dictate terms to me.~
@2710 = ~(sigh) Never mind.~
@2711 = ~There is always hope, <CHARNAME>, remember that. I want to help you. I only hope you'll let me.~
@2712 = ~I could ask no more.~
@2713 = ~(As promised, Gavin comes to you as you prepare for bed. He wears only shirt and leggings, and looks ill at ease, despite his smile. He embraces you awkwardly, visibly shaking with suppressed emotion.)~ [bg_blank]
@2714 = ~I have come, my love. Do you still want to... lie with me?~
@2715 = ~I have come. Do you still want to... lie with me?~
@2716 = ~I need more time to decide.~
@2717 = ~I'm sorry, Gavin, but I'm not ready yet, after all.~
@2718 = ~Oh, sweet, beloved <CHARNAME>...~
@2719 = ~(Gavin kisses you tenderly, gently stroking your hair. For many moments, he holds you thus, giving you time to get used to his nearness.)~
@2720 = ~I understand, dear one. I will return to my own bedroll, and give you whatever time you need.~
@2721 = ~Sweet <CHARNAME>, do not be sorry. This is important to both of us, and I would not have you rushed into making a decision before you are ready. Come to me again when you are, but for now, I will return to my own bedroll and dream of your cheek against my shoulder.~
@2722 = ~(Gavin kisses you, gently stroking your hair. For many moments, he holds you thus, giving you time to get used to his nearness.)~
@2723 = ~I understand. I will return to my own bedroll.~
@2724 = ~Do not be sorry. I will return to my own bedroll, and we may speak more of this another time, if you wish.~
@2725 = ~(After a time, his kiss becomes more passionate, and you feel his pulse quicken.)~
@2726 = ~(Gavin shivers as your cool fingers slide over his skin. You feel him tense slightly as your fingertips brush a scar beneath his shoulderblade, but he offers no resistance as you explore his torso.)~
@2727 = ~I'm starting to think it might be a mistake to bed each other. Our emotions might lead us to do something rash.~
@2728 = ~(Gavin's breath is a shuddering gasp.) I'm having all I can do to keep myself in check, love, though I will if you want. I'm sorry, but I've wanted this moment for so long, it's hard to control myself. Do you want me to stop?~
@2729 = ~(Gavin's breath is a shuddering gasp.) I'm having all I can do to keep myself in check, but I will. Do you want me to stop?~
@2730 = ~I am sorry. I was carried away by the moment, but if you want to wait, I'll gladly wait.~
@2731 = ~It just feels so rushed. I don't know if I'm ready to discover you that completely quite yet.~
@2732 = ~<CHARNAME>, I... I want to please you, but I don't know how.~
@2733 = ~Maybe this is too much too soon. Our emotions might be out of control.~
@2734 = ~You have to remind me of that now?~
@2735 = ~Relax, Gavin. Your body knows what to do... and if you run out of ideas, I'm sure we can come up with something together.~
@2736 = ~You don't need to be the best lover Faerun has ever known. You just have to mean it.~
@2737 = ~Don't be nervous, Gavin. It won't help.~
@2738 = ~You're right.~
